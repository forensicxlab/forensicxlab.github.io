      <description>Abstract Link to heading Windows executable analysis is a key aspect of Digital Forensics and Reverse Malware Engineering. Identifying the capabilities of a program can help to target potential malicious code and orient the later reverse code analysis phase. In this blogpost, we will dive into the structure of the Windows Portable Executable (PE) and how we can extract the imported functions in the context of memory analysis.
Windows PE Format Link to heading A portable executable (PE) 1 is a file format used by Windows to store executable programs, libraries (DLLs) and object files.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading The Master File Table (MFT) is the core metadata structure for the New Technology File System (NTFS). This table can be seen as a database that contains every information needed to describe all the files. The MFT itself is stored on the disk, usually in a reserved area at the beginning of the partition. When accessing a file on an NTFS volume, the operating system looks up the file&amp;rsquo;s MFT entry to retrieve the necessary information.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading In the Digital Forensics ecosystem, the field of memory forensics can help uncover artifacts that canâ€™t be found anywhere else. That can include deleted files, network connections, running processes, rootkits, code injection, fileless malware and many more.
Microsoft introduced the hibernation feature in Windows 2000, allowing systems to be powered down while preserving their volatile state. This is achieved by saving RAM contents and processor context to a file called hiberfil.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading Memory forensics is a huge help when performing an investigation and during incident response. Collecting memory images and analyzing them at scale is a challenge.
It is crucial to have the capability of examining memory images on storage platforms other than traditional file systems. With the emergence of cloud technologies, new forms of storage known as object storage have emerged. Enabling memory analysis on object storage provides exciting opportunities for innovation and advancement.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading Being interested in memory forensic for a while now, I have learned a lot about the volatility3 framework. In this article, we will go through how you can use the framework&amp;rsquo;s libraries to automate your memory analysis tasks and directly exploit the results. I will assume in this article that the reader has a basic understanding of how volatility3 is exploiting memory to extract evidence. If you want to learn more about volatility3, you can check the links in the &amp;ldquo;References&amp;rdquo; section.</description>
