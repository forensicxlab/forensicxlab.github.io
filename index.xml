      <description>Abstract Link to heading On May 1st, 2023, vdhoney1 raised concerns about an issue found on KeePass 2.X 2 were he was able to reconstruct the master password. A POC 3 was later released by the researcher in dotnet, and another in python3 4. Today we will describe the vulnerability and see how we can create a volatility3 plugin to help forensics investigators retrieve passwords.
Vulnerability description Link to heading The vulnerability (CVE-2023-32784 5) reside in the basic KeePass version 2.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading As a digital forensic expert, proving the authenticity and reliability of a forensic image in court is essential. Indeed, the integrity of the data needs to be maintained during the imaging process, preventing any accidental or intentional modification of the data. The Expert Witness Compression Format (EWF) provides a way to store metadata about the image, such as the source device, imaging tool, checksums, signatures, and other relevant information about the acquired media.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading Malware analysis is very useful when performing a digital investigation. Indeed, identifying how a malware works and determining its behavior is very useful to detect future attacks, other compromised equipment, make critical choices and discover new TTPs. In this blog article, we will dive into the behavioral analysis of the latest QBOT campaign using malicious OneNote documents as an initial vector to compromise a host and deploy stealers.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading When performing incident response, the adversary often uses legitimate remote access software as an interactive command and control channel. AnyDesk1 is one of those software being extensively used as a sublayer of persistence by threat actors or access other servers in the environment via RDP2.
The latter has been often encountered in the wild in the past years as a preferred tool leveraged by known threat actors.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading The filesystem is one of the most basic and important concepts in UNIX/Linux. This concept is working around the idea that ‚Äúeverything is a file‚Äù, meaning that the hardware, regular files, directories, sockets, kernel data structures, process communications etc are represented as files with their own types. On a filesystem, a file (whatever its type) is assigned with a number called an &amp;ldquo;inode&amp;rdquo;. An inode is an interface between the blocks on the filesystem and the file.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading Windows prefetch files are temporary files stored in the %SystemRoot%\System\Prefetch folder. This memory management feature is keeping track of the frequently running applications on a given system. We can extract some data from those files in order to get useful information for a digital forensic investigation. In this blog article, I will explain how we can use memory forensic to extract prefetch files, parse them and create in the end a volatility3 plugin.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading Being interested in memory forensic for a while now, I have learned a lot about the volatility3 framework. In this article, we will go through how you can use the framework&amp;rsquo;s libraries to automate your memory analysis tasks and directly exploit the results. I will assume in this article that the reader has a basic understanding of how volatility3 is exploiting memory to extract evidence. If you want to learn more about volatility3, you can check the links in the &amp;ldquo;References&amp;rdquo; section.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading Being interested in memory forensic for a while now I have learned a lot about the Volatility framework. This article will introduce volatility3 core components and focus on kernel symbols. Next, I will explain the steps I took to generate a lot of MacOs SymbolTables. Finally you will be able to retrieve those SymbolsTables directly from github. The final goal is to create a public repository like windows to automatically identify mac os system version and directly download the associated SymbolTables.</description>
