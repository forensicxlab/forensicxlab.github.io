      <description>Abstract Link to heading In the Digital Forensics ecosystem, the field of memory forensics can help uncover artifacts that canâ€™t be found anywhere else. That can include deleted files, network connections, running processes, rootkits, code injection, fileless malware and many more.
Microsoft introduced the hibernation feature in Windows 2000, allowing systems to be powered down while preserving their volatile state. This is achieved by saving RAM contents and processor context to a file called hiberfil.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading Memory forensics is a huge help when performing an investigation and during incident response. Collecting memory images and analyzing them at scale is a challenge.
It is crucial to have the capability of examining memory images on storage platforms other than traditional file systems. With the emergence of cloud technologies, new forms of storage known as object storage have emerged. Enabling memory analysis on object storage provides exciting opportunities for innovation and advancement.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading Being interested in memory forensic for a while now, I have learned a lot about the volatility3 framework. In this article, we will go through how you can use the framework&amp;rsquo;s libraries to automate your memory analysis tasks and directly exploit the results. I will assume in this article that the reader has a basic understanding of how volatility3 is exploiting memory to extract evidence. If you want to learn more about volatility3, you can check the links in the &amp;ldquo;References&amp;rdquo; section.</description>
