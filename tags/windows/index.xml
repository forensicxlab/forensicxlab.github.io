      <description>Abstract Link to heading Malware analysis is very useful when performing a digital investigation. Indeed, identifying how a malware works and determining its behavior is very useful to detect future attacks, other compromised equipment, make critical choices and discover new TTPs. In this blog article, we will dive into the behavioral analysis of the latest QBOT campaign using malicious OneNote documents as an initial vector to compromise a host and deploy stealers.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading Windows prefetch files are temporary files stored in the %SystemRoot%\System\Prefetch folder. This memory management feature is keeping track of the frequently running applications on a given system. We can extract some data from those files in order to get useful information for a digital forensic investigation. In this blog article, I will explain how we can use memory forensic to extract prefetch files, parse them and create in the end a volatility3 plugin.</description>
