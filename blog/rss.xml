            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the objective of implementing the modern Apple File System (APFS) module of the <code>[exhume</code> toolkit](<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/docs/exhume" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.forensicxlab.com/docs/exhume</a>), a test disk image from a recent macOS system was required. In practice, acquiring <em>physical</em> data from modern Apple hardware (especially with T2 / security constraints) quickly narrows the tooling landscape, and <strong>Cellebrite BlackLight / MacQuisition</strong> seems to be the default choice.</p>
<p>After acquiring disk image of a modern Apple computer, the output format was <strong>AFF4</strong> (Advanced Forensics File Format v4). After not being able to convert this image to a raw disk image on my operating system and, in a quest to make the digital forensics investigation platform agnostic, the next step was obvious: add AFF4 support to exhume_body and make it reliable enough to feed an APFS parser.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I describe that journey and the key findings along the way. The important part is this: <strong>MacQuisition produces an AFF4 that strongly diverges from what most public AFF4 descriptions (and many OSS parsers) that I have found assume</strong>, which makes existing implementations fail or perform poorly.</p>
<p>Let’s solve this properly.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Before going down the rabbit hole, I tried the obvious shortcut: export the AFF4 to a raw disk image and feed that to the APFS parser.</p>
<p>My first attempt was to export to raw with <a href="https://aff4-imager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aff4imager</a></p>
<div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">aff4imager </span><span class="token parameter variable" style="color:rgb(189, 147, 249);font-style:italic">-e</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:rgb(255, 121, 198)">'aff4://f47e5cb5-c0e1-4301-b382-67f73f3b02ce'</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token parameter variable" style="color:rgb(189, 147, 249);font-style:italic">--export_dir</span><span class="token plain"> test/ ~/IMAGE.aff4</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>However, the tool output is the following:</p>
<div class="language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_QJqH"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#F8F8F2;background-color:#282A36"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Compression method https://code.google.com/p/lz4/ is not supported by this implementation.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">Compression method https://code.google.com/p/lz4/ is not supported by this implementation.</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, that’s… not right and I couldn't mount this aff4 image on my mac. And for this injustice, I redirected my full focus onto <strong>this specific AFF4 implementation</strong>. The following sections describe the journey and how to reliably read bytes from this MacQuisition-produced AFF4 starting from scratch. Note that my implementation needs to be tested on other images in order to make it more robust. This is not an academic paper, the next sections contain the information and conceptes I have learned and understood and therefore subjective. It could lack some information. Make sure to send me a message if some of what you are reading needs to be modified!</p>
<h1>Background on AFF4</h1>
<p>AFF4 (Advanced Forensics Format Version 4) is not just a disk image format like we saw with <a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EWF</a>. It is a <strong>container + data model</strong> designed for forensic acquisition workflows.</p>
<p>AFF version 4 was completed in 2009 by Michael Cohen, Simson Garfinkel, and Bradley Schatz. The design was introduced in their paper: "Extending the advanced forensic format to accommodate multiple data sources, logical evidence, arbitrary information and forensic workflow," published in Digital Investigation 6 (2009), S57–S68. That publication shipped alongside an early reference implementation written in Python. The version later made available via aff4.org is a separate, open-source reimplementation intended to serve as a general-purpose AFF4 library.</p>
<p>A useful snapshot of the motivation and historical context appears in a 2010 Digital Investigation article (vol. 7) titled "Hash based disk imaging using AFF4." The authors contrast earlier approaches to forensic imaging—first, raw “bit-for-bit” acquisition (often described as dd images), and then block-based compression methods that improved storage efficiency but could increase acquisition time. They position AFF4 as a "third generation" forensic format: one that brings multiple image streams, arbitrary metadata, and storage virtualization directly into the file format itself.</p>
<p>Since, some digital forensics vendors were also able to develop their own implementations of AFF4 acquisition, and not a lot of documentation on the evolutions of the format since 2010 is available online.</p>
<h1>AFF4 high-level structure overview</h1>
<p>As usual, let's start simple (and therefore in a vulgarised way) to describe an AFF4 image. At its base, AFF4 is just a ZIP file using the Zip64 extension. This is the main "container" for storing <strong>streams</strong> and <strong>metadata</strong> files.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/1-53ac63b335e67d7d970e39ce5f5fe78d.png" title="High level overview" width="2318" height="1432" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Inside the AFF4 container directory structure, we can find a file named "information.turtle". Unlike the EWF format that we have studied in earlier blog posts, AFF4 doesn't use fixed binary headers for metadata. Instead, it is using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) serialised as "Turtle" (Terse RDF Triple Language). The "information.turtle" zip member contains the metadata needed to describe the layout of the AFF4 image. The metadata stored inside the information turtle informs our tool about record <strong>object</strong> types, attributes (sizes, chunking parameters, timestamps, tool info), and relationships between <strong>objects</strong>. I will dive into more details later.</p>
<p>Let's talk vocabulary! in AFF4, each "<strong>Object</strong>" is identified with a unique <strong>URN</strong> (Uniform Resource Name).</p>
<p>In the context of this blog post, I divide AFF4 Objects into three categories: The <strong>Evidence</strong> object(s), the <strong>Map</strong> object(s) and the <strong>Image</strong> object(s). The Map &amp; Image are not stored as one blob, AFF4 models the evidence bytes as a sequential, addressable flow of bytes. We will refer to them as <strong>MapStream</strong> and <strong>ImageStream</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Evidence</strong> object is the thing we want to mount/read: for example, a disk image.</li>
<li>The <strong>MapStream</strong> object provides the necessary information to obtain one logical "view" of an acquired disk image, a partition image, a file, a carved artefact, etc.</li>
<li>The <strong>ImageStream</strong> object is the backing storage that provides the bytes for one or more views.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we <strong>can have multiple ImageStream objects</strong> if we perform the acquisition of multiple sources. For example, we could acquire a disk image into a first image object and the memory of the machine in another one.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-information-turtle">The information Turtle<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/exhume-aff4#the-information-turtle" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The information Turtle" title="Direct link to The information Turtle">​</a></h2>
<p>The information turtle gives us the important metadata between the acquired Evidence(s) layout and the generated logical AFF4 layout. This is not optional decoration: readers <em>must</em> use it to interpret the container like mentioned in the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742287609000401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">main article about the subject</a>. Let's take a look at the information turtle of the Cellebrite/MacQuisition produced AFF4 image.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/4-8b476a211c50751810243d1dd1066be3.png" title="Information Turtle Example" width="2152" height="1175" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In this example, a total of <strong>242837545 blocks</strong> of <strong>4096 bytes each</strong> were acquired and are representing an <strong>APFSContainerImage</strong>.</p>
<p>In the AFF4 world, the acquired blocks from the source evidence are concatenated into <strong>Chunks</strong>. In our example, the size of a chunk is 32768 bytes (= 8 * 4096 = 8 blocks). Multiple chunks are stored into <strong>Segments</strong>. In our example, the number of chunk in one Segment is 1024. In AFF4 each Segments are backed up as a file in the container (ZIP) for a total size of 53861023744 bytes (~50Gb).</p>
<p>To know the number of segments, we can use the following math: number_of_segments = total_size / size_of_one_segment.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/6-5ea62ba33925768e6c0cef08feea1364.png" title="Map target dictionnary" width="3662" height="2257" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In our case: number_of_segments = 53861023744 / (1024 * 32768) = 1605 Segments !</p>
<p>That is great, we have the necessary metadata to retrieve the information about the Segments, the blocks and the URNs used to store the bytes. But now, how can I extract 512 bytes of data from offset 0x12502 "from the point of view" of the original evidence? AFF4 doesn't store sparse data when using the Map object during acquisition, so it needs to keep track of the original acquired offsets and the image. We still need the <strong>Map</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-map">The Map<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/exhume-aff4#the-map" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Map" title="Direct link to The Map">​</a></h2>
<p>The Map Object allows us to know the mapping between the acquired image and it's logical representation. The map basically allows us to perform: "<em><strong>If I want 512 bytes from offset 0x1215 in the original (virtual) aquired image, I need to look at offset 0x.... in the AFF4 ImageStream X</strong></em>"</p>
<p>Many published examples show that the MapStream is stored in the AFF4 container (ZIP) as two records:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The target dictionary</strong>: Association between an ID and the name of the byte stream.</li>
<li><strong>The intervals list</strong>: A (originally) text-map composed of multiple records. Each record holds the following:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Virtual offset: virtual/logical start offset in the map’s logical stream;</li>
<li>Length: number of bytes in this extent (the run length);</li>
<li>Target offset: start offset in the backing target stream where those bytes come from;</li>
<li>Index: which target stream (lookup in the map’s /idx table).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of our Cellebrite/MacQuisition AFF4 container:</p>
<ul>
<li>The target dictionary is stored in the ZipFile record: aff4://1ddcf287-f499-492a-ab06-7edec982b094/<strong>idx</strong></li>
<li>The intervals list is stored in the ZipFile record: aff4://1ddcf287-f499-492a-ab06-7edec982b094/<strong>map</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The following was not documented anywhere I've looked online. This is based on the deep inspection of my acquisition image.</strong></p>
<p>MacQuisition’s AFF4 map stream is not a line-oriented "text map". It is a packed binary array of fixed-size records. Each record is <strong>28 bytes</strong>, little-endian:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/7-d14b206fa13c55232ed8c8ee341c6b56.png" title="Map records" width="1748" height="1014" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:right">Byte range (inclusive-exclusive)</th><th style="text-align:right">Size</th><th>Type (LE)</th><th>Field</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code>0..8</code></td><td style="text-align:right">8</td><td><code>u64</code></td><td><code>virtual_offset</code></td><td>Start offset in the <strong>virtual image</strong> (the reconstructed address space)</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code>8..16</code></td><td style="text-align:right">8</td><td><code>u64</code></td><td><code>extent_len</code></td><td>Length in bytes of this mapping run (0 may be used as a sentinel/hole marker)</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code>16..24</code></td><td style="text-align:right">8</td><td><code>u64</code></td><td><code>target_offset</code></td><td>Offset in the <strong>target stream</strong> where data is sourced from</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code>24..28</code></td><td style="text-align:right">4</td><td><code>u32</code></td><td><code>target_index</code></td><td>Index into the adjacent <strong>idx table</strong> (string table of target URIs)</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>For a given record:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The virtual range covered is:</p>
<p><code>virtual_offset .. virtual_offset + extent_len</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The corresponding bytes are read from:</p>
<p><code>target_uri[target_index]</code> at offset <code>target_offset</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-idx-table-next-to-it">The <code>idx</code> table next to it<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/exhume-aff4#the-idx-table-next-to-it" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-idx-table-next-to-it" title="Direct link to the-idx-table-next-to-it">​</a></h3>
<p>The map does not store the target URIs inline. It is using the member next to it (<code>.../idx</code>) which is a <strong>NUL-separated string table</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split by <code>0x00</code></li>
<li>Each string is a target URI (e.g. <code>aff4://.../data</code>)</li>
<li><code>target_index</code> in the 28-byte record selects one of these strings</li>
</ul>
<p>This reduces map size significantly when many records refer to the same target stream.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/2-6b7a445d035f2148cf99a5c192b2753c.png" title="Map target dictionnary" width="2490" height="1596" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-segments">The Segments<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/exhume-aff4#the-segments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Segments" title="Direct link to The Segments">​</a></h2>
<p>In the AFF4 world, and specifically in our case, each segment can be backed by a file in the AFF4 container (ZIP).
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>aff4://1ddcf287-f499-492a-ab06-7edec982b094/00000001 contains the segment number 1</li>
<li>aff4://1ddcf287-f499-492a-ab06-7edec982b094/00000002 contains the segment number 2</li>
<li>etc..</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In our case we have 1605 segments, so it will go from aff4://1ddcf287-f499-492a-ab06-7edec982b094/00000001 to aff4://1ddcf287-f499-492a-ab06-7edec982b094/00001605</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-cellebritemacaquisition-divergence">The Cellebrite/MacAquisition divergence<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/exhume-aff4#the-cellebritemacaquisition-divergence" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Cellebrite/MacAquisition divergence" title="Direct link to The Cellebrite/MacAquisition divergence">​</a></h3>
<p><strong>The following is not documented anywhere I've looked online. This is based on the inspection of my acquisition image.</strong></p>
<p>If you come back to the metadata of the information turtle showed, you can see a property named:</p>
<p><code>aff4:compressionMethod &lt;https://code.google.com/p/lz4/&gt; ;</code></p>
<p>That means every chunk is compressed before being stored in the segments. <strong>So we actually have segments that can contain compressed chunks using the lz4 compression method</strong></p>
<p>In the case of Cellebrite/MacAquisition, and in order to keep track of the variable lengths and offsets of each compressed chunks, they also stores an <strong>index</strong> file alongside each segment member. These "segments indexes" are composed of <strong>12-byte entries</strong>.</p>
<p>Each entry is 12 bytes, little-endian, and it encodes (compressed offset, compressed length) for one chunk inside the corresponding segment member’s payload.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:right">Byte range (inclusive-exclusive)</th><th style="text-align:right">Size</th><th>Type (LE)</th><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code>0..4</code></td><td style="text-align:right">4</td><td><code>u32</code></td><td><code>lo</code></td><td>Low 32 bits of the chunk blob offset (<code>c_off</code>) within the <strong>segment member payload</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code>4..8</code></td><td style="text-align:right">4</td><td><code>u32</code></td><td><code>hi</code></td><td>High 32 bits of the chunk blob offset (<code>c_off</code>) within the <strong>segment member payload</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:right"><code>8..12</code></td><td style="text-align:right">4</td><td><code>u32</code></td><td><code>len</code></td><td>Length in bytes of the chunk blob (<code>c_len</code>) stored in the segment member</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>So why would you compress the chunks? It's clearly not to be able to store more chunks into each segments because from the metadata we have, the segment boundaries are stable and we just benefit from smaller members. The main reason is probably to lower disk I/O when performing data read from disk to reconstruct a chunk in memory.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/5-fd094b737b9ffe1c697fe2634ee0fa37.png" title="Map target dictionnary" width="2208" height="2257" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-read-data">How to read data<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/exhume-aff4#how-to-read-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to read data" title="Direct link to How to read data">​</a></h2>
<p>At this point, we know the container is Zip64, and that MacQuisition’s AFF4 differs in two key places:</p>
<ul>
<li>The map is a packed binary array (28-byte records), not a line-based text map</li>
<li>The data is stored as LZ4-compressed chunks inside segment members, with a per-segment .index file to locate each compressed chunk</li>
</ul>
<p>So reading bytes can happen in the following order: virtual offset → map interval → target stream offset → segment + chunk → (offset,len) via index → LZ4 decode → slice.</p>
<p>In order to implement the exhume_body aff4 support, I first needed to parse the Zip64 central directory and build a dictionary of <code>member name → {header offset; sizes; zip compression method}</code>. Not going into details on how to parse a Zip64 archive but just note that I am using it constantly to fetch information.turtle, the map members, segment members, and the per-segment .index files.</p>
<p>Then, from the Turtle RDF metadata, we extract the values that drive all addressing math:</p>
<ul>
<li>image_size</li>
<li>chunk_size</li>
<li>chunks_in_segment</li>
<li>compressionMethod (here: LZ4)</li>
<li>the URNs/base paths for the map object and the data stream</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned in my previous observations, Cellebrite/MacQuisition stores two adjacent map members:</p>
<ul>
<li>.../idx → NUL-separated string table of target URIs</li>
<li>.../map → packed 28-byte records (LE): (virtual_offset<!-- -->:u64<!-- -->, extent_len<!-- -->:u64<!-- -->, target_offset<!-- -->:u64<!-- -->, target_index<!-- -->:u32<!-- -->)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm turning these into an in-memory interval list:</p>
<ul>
<li>each interval maps a virtual range to (target_uri, target_offset)</li>
<li>sort by virtual_offset</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reading-n-bytes-at-virtual-offset-v">Reading N bytes at virtual offset V<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/exhume-aff4#reading-n-bytes-at-virtual-offset-v" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Reading N bytes at virtual offset V" title="Direct link to Reading N bytes at virtual offset V">​</a></h3>
<p>The following pseudo-code algorithm is a summary of the actions performed to read N bytes at a virtual offset V.</p>
<ul>
<li>find which interval covers the current position (binary search)</li>
<li>if no interval: it’s a hole → zero-fill</li>
<li>if interval found:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>compute the logical offset inside the target stream:</li>
<li>logical_off = interval.target_offset + (pos - interval.virtual_offset).</li>
<li>fetch bytes from the target stream at logical_off (next section).</li>
<li>repeat until the request is satisfied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Integration to the exhume Toolkit</h1>
<p>Well, the final result is that exhume_body now supports aff4 as a new format and therefore all of the exhume_modules above (like exhume_filesystem, exhume_partitions, ...).</p>
<p>In order to test the implementation, you can perform the following:</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Well, this journey was painful. But now I can read MacOs MacQuisitions and begin developing the Exhume APFS module, which was the original objective for the Thanatology project.</p>
<p>My implementation HAS TO BE CONSIDERED AS VERY SPECIFC to the Cellebrite/MacQuisition AFF4 images for now until I put my hands on more images. Feel free to test it, raise any issues you might find on Github or on the dedicated <a href="https://discord.com/invite/AqkYgR5HEg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord Server</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog post is part of the Thanatology blog post series. If you haven’t checked it out, I recommend reading the following first:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thanatology part 1: Introduction to the Thanatology project</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thanatology part 2: Multiple disk images formats handling using the Exhume ToolKit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thanatology part 3: MBR and GPT forensics with the Exhume ToolKit.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the previous part, we discovered how to perform partition discovery for the MBR and GPT layouts. The next step in our digital forensics examination process of a disk image is to identify the type of Filesystem present on a given partition and extract relevant data. In this blog post, we will first dive into the concept of file systems in general. Next, we will explore how the Exhume toolkit is designed to propose a way to understand multiple kinds of file systems and introduce an abstraction module. Finally, some updates on the Thanatology project will be proposed.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="filesystems">Filesystems<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-4#filesystems" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Filesystems" title="Direct link to Filesystems">​</a></h2>
<p>As humans, we began to keep everything recorded and organised in the physical world to track our actions over time. If you are looking for a payment you made three months ago to someone who is claiming you didn't, you will be able to prove that the accusation is wrong by looking inside the record containing all of your expenses in time. If you forgot one ingredient for how to cook your favourite recipe, you'll be happy to check the record containing the recipe. In the end, to record and keep things organised, you need a physical and trustworthy tool, such as a pen and paper or a book.</p>
<p>Well, a book is fine for keeping your recipes, but the amount of information we have to keep track of is now enormous, and computers are addressing this need with success. Instead of having an enormous room with a lot of books, everything can now be shrunk and stored in digital long-term memory storage objects (Hard drives, SSDs, etc.).</p>

<p>Now, how would you keep your library organised? How would you sort, categorise, and access them? What would you do if you wanted to get rid of the content of a book? Would you burn it? Just remove what was written on each pages to be able to write in the same book again?</p>
<p>The fact is that now, as a user of an operating system, you don't really control the organisation of your "library" anymore; you are bound to ask to manipulate the data you want to interact with, with no say on how it is stored or organised. You could say: "<em>On my machine, I'm managing my files and folders as you would in a library</em>". But it is you working with a layer of abstraction provided by the operating system to manipulate data. When you click on the "Delete" button to remove a file from your disk, you are not really in control of how the file will be deleted (how your book will be destroyed); you are just "asking" your <strong>operating system</strong> to do it for you. It's as if you are now interacting with a librarian. You ask for information from a book, and the librarian will take care of it for you. They know the organisation of the library and how to access the information you want, so you don't have to worry about it anymore. You are trusting this person to manage the library well.</p>
<p>In our digital world now, <strong>a filesystem is an organisational methodology used to keep your files organised on a digital storage solution</strong>. An like there are different ways to keep a library organised, there is different ways to manage files on a storage medium. Therefore, other kinds of file systems exist. The operating system's job is to understand how to work with the file system to provide data to the end user. In our case, the librarian is the operating system.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/2-f6ba1c6a3eb9bd3f8dfeb223712c714d.svg" title="The librarian" width="1096" height="715" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Let's say you are an investigator. A person is under arrest for a crime; the information that he is guilty is potentially stored in his personal library, managed by his librarian. However, you will not be able to ask the librarian anything, as you have frozen the place, and the librarian of the suspect cannot be approached. You now need to understand how the library is organised: how books are stored and accessed, and how they are shelved. If they are not well shredded, you can maybe retrieve some pages.</p>
<p>In the digital forensics world, the same principle applies; you cannot directly investigate using the suspect's operating system. Instead, you freeze the data to ensure integrity is preserved.</p>
<p>I'm using the word "freeze" , but in practice, in the digital forensics field, that means we perform analysis in a way that does not modify the evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>We keep access read-only (write-blocking for physical drives, or read-only handling for images).</li>
<li>We avoid using the suspect operating system to interpret the disk, and we avoid any operation that could modify metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, you need to understand what kind of file system is used and how it manages the records (files) and organises them. The better understanding you have of a filesystem, the better you'll be able to retrieve information. By design, some file systems do not completely delete records for performance reasons, for example.</p>
<p>Returning to our library metaphor, if you had multiple library experts on your team who understand various library organisations, you could ask them to retrieve a specific record for you. In the digital forensics, that would be the toolsets of a digital forensics tools to understand multiple kinds of file systems.</p>

<p>The first quick conclusion we can make is: <strong>the better a digital forensics investigator understands how a filesystem works and its inner workings, the better they will be able to extract the data they need to build their case.</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kinds-of-filesystems">Kinds of Filesystems<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-4#kinds-of-filesystems" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Kinds of Filesystems" title="Direct link to Kinds of Filesystems">​</a></h2>
<p>There are many file system types, each providing ways to store data depending on the goals. Not all of the filesystems can be "understood" by a single operating systems. Operating systems are usually built to work with some specific file systems. For example, Microsoft Windows, by default, works with the New Technology File System (NTFS) but cannot work with the Extended Filesystem Version 4 (ext4) by default, whereas the Linux Operating system, for example, can work with ext4. As a digital forensics investigator, the better we understand a file system and how the operating system uses it to store information, the better we can build the dedicated tools to extract artefacts. There are many file system types, you can find an exhaustive list here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_systems</a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-exhume-toolkit---filesystem-investigation">The Exhume ToolKit - Filesystem investigation<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-4#the-exhume-toolkit---filesystem-investigation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Exhume ToolKit - Filesystem investigation" title="Direct link to The Exhume ToolKit - Filesystem investigation">​</a></h2>
<p>To be able to interact with these types of filesystems from a digital forensics perspective, we have architected the exhume framework to provide the digital forensics experts and investigators with the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dive into a file system type and extract information related to its specific characteristics.</li>
<li>Propose API functions for each module to develop specific extraction modules that automate artefact collection.</li>
<li>Provide a higher level of abstraction that normalises information across filesystem types.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exhume-filesystem-modules">Exhume Filesystem modules<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-4#exhume-filesystem-modules" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Exhume Filesystem modules" title="Direct link to Exhume Filesystem modules">​</a></h3>
<p>The principle is as follows: for each filesystem type, an exhume module is created, providing a Command Line Interface for some investigators and API functions for investigators with developing skills. This way, each exhume module can be customised to propose unique features related to this specific file system type. An expert in a particular kind of file system can contribute to developing specific functionalities that enhance its capabilities for a particular digital forensic task.</p>

<p>The Exhume Toolkit currently propose three filesystem modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>ExFAT (exhume_exfat)</li>
<li>Extended Filesystem (exhume_extfs)</li>
<li>New Technology Filesystem (exhume_ntfs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each is capable of understanding the associated file systems and can extract specific data. They can be enhanced by the community at any point, making them very flexible.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="an-example">An Example<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-4#an-example" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to An Example" title="Direct link to An Example">​</a></h4>
<p>Let's see an example. I have here a digital forensics disk image. I have discovered it is using a Linux Filesystem using the exhume_partitions module's CLI.</p>
<p>Using the following command: <code>exhume_partitions --body workshop-kali.E01</code></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/5-d7a5bb91ee764ecb2e4a5af72cb864d0.png" title="Exhume Modules" width="5505" height="2376" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In this situation, the Linux Filesystem starts at the absolute address offset <strong>0x100000</strong> and has a size of <strong>0x9c00000</strong> sectors. Let's try to use the exhume_extfs module. First, we need to install it with the following command:</p>
<p><code>cargo install exhume_extfs</code></p>
<p>Next, we can get information about the cli using the following command:</p>
<p><code>exhume_extfs --help</code></p>

<p>In the Extended File System, the superblock holds important metadata about how this file system stores files. Let's try to print the superblock information using the following command:</p>
<p><code>exhume_extfs --body workshop-kali.E01 --offset 0x100000 --size 0x9c00000 --superblock</code></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/6-5cf28d6e4da70ca7519e63aa3c6638d9.png" title="Exhume Modules" width="3507" height="6216" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>To fully understand the output, the digital forensics investigator must be educated on the internals of this specific file system. Therefore, the exhume module dedicated to this file system aims to provide everything the experts need to retrieve the information.</p>
<p>In the extended file system world, files and directories are all represented and identified as "inodes". The root directory has the inode number 2. We can display the Inode 2 directory entry members with the following command:</p>
<p><code>exhume_extfs --body workshop_kali.E01 --offset 0x100000 --size 0x9c00000 --inode 2 --dir_entry</code></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/7-ad5ea370e0b35f21b49d81f37bc4db05.png" title="Exhume Modules" width="3213" height="2256" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Here we are witnessing the list of inodes in the directory entry of the inode number 2. We can also, for example, retrieve the metadata about  inode two just with the following:</p>
<p><code>exhume_extfs --body workshop_kali.E01 --offset 0x100000 --size 0x9c00000 --inode 2</code></p>

<p>The filesystem-specific modules are functional for experts who have a deep understanding of their layout. However, digital investigators usually want to be able to quickly extract files to index them in a normalised way and get into details maybe later, depending on the context.</p>
<p>For this, I had to think of a top-level filesystem extraction module to automatically detect the filesystem and propose basic digital forensics features that can be achieved by combining the shared characteristics across filesystems. The following was identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filesystem metadata extraction</li>
<li>Filesystem enumeration</li>
<li>File metadata extraction</li>
<li>File content extraction</li>
</ul>
<p>We have abstracted the concepts of a File and a DirectoryEntry using the power of Rust traits. Using this methodology, each filesystem type implemented in the future can also implement the Filesystem Trait of exhume_filesystem.</p>

However, a normalised model will always hide important filesystem-specific semantics. For example:</p><ul>
<li>Timestamps are not equivalent across file systems (and even within a single file system). "Deletion time" may not exist or may have different update rules.</li>
<li>Identity differs: ext4 uses inodes, NTFS uses MFT record, and exFAT uses directory entry structures. We use the identification system of the filesystem itself when present and create our own when it is not present.</li>
<li>Some features are filesystem-specific (e.g., NTFS Alternate Data Streams) and have no direct equivalent in other file systems.</li>
</ul><p>For this reason, the abstraction layer focuses on everyday operations (enumeration, basic metadata, content extraction) while each filesystem module can expose extended/raw metadata for deeper analysis.</p></div></div>

<p>To use exhume_filesystem, we can install it with the following command:</p>
<p><code>cargo install exhume_filesystem</code></p>
<p>Similarly, we can execute this module on our disk image and enumerate all files using the <code>--enum</code> flag.</p>
<p>Using our previous disk image following command is used: <code>exhume_filesystem --body workshop-kali.E01 --offset 0x100000 --size 0x9c00000 --enum</code></p>

<p>You can see that exhume_filesystem detects the filesystem used and, if compatible, executes the filesystem enumeration function related to the extended filesystem in that case. The following output is the result ran on an NTFS file system.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the first part of this series, one of my goals is to create a high-level Digital Forensics investigation tool for investigators, usable by people with different levels of expertise. The Exhume Toolkit API is used as the core engine for this project.</p>
<p>The decision was made to divide the investigation of the disk image into multiple stages, which I will describe below.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-1-filesystem-identification">Step 1: Filesystem identification<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-4#step-1-filesystem-identification" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: Filesystem identification" title="Direct link to Step 1: Filesystem identification">​</a></h3>
<p>When choosing the partition to process by the Thanatology engine, the exhume_filesystem detection library is used to check if the targeted filesystem is supported.</p>

<p>Using the exhume_filesystem API, we can enumerate every file and index them in a SQLite database to perform other actions on them later and display the extracted metadata to the user.</p>
<p>Thanatology will first discover and index all the files in the SQLite database, then execute other analysis dedicated modules, such as file type identification, artefact extraction, and more, in due time.</p>

<p>Now that the files are indexed, we can provide the user with a visualisation interface. He will be able to interact with the file. If the investigator wants to fetch the content of a file, he will be able to do so. The exhume_filesystem API will be used behind the scenes to fetch the data.</p>

<p>In this part, we moved from partition discovery to filesystem-level forensics:</p>
<ul>
<li>We introduced why investigators need to understand filesystem on-disk structures.</li>
<li>We showed how Exhume’s filesystem modules expose deep, filesystem-specific views and capabilities.</li>
<li>We presented exhume_filesystem, a higher-level layer that can detect supported file systems and provide standard capabilities, such as enumeration, basic metadata extraction, and file content extraction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The abstraction layer intentionally focuses on common denominators; some filesystem-specific semantics (multiple timestamp sources, NTFS ADS, special metadata) are best handled in the dedicated modules.</p>
<p>In the next part of the series, we will build on the indexed filesystem view to automate artefact extraction and analysis modules (file type identification, targeted parsers, and timeline-oriented workflows). We will link to Thanatology’s database-backed approach.</p>

<p>Following the parity release of the Volatility3 v2.26 framwework, we updated VolWeb to add the latest plugins, fix some issues and add some new features ! Learn more about the news in this blogpost.</p>
<p>In this new version of VolWeb, we added some of the plugins released in the <a href="https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3/releases/tag/v2.26.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2.26 version of Volatility3</a> to the VolWeb Engine for Windows and Linux memory forensics. We also added the Linux Explore feature, a Kubernetes manifest example and fixed some bugs.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-new-features">🔬 New Features<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/volweb-3-15#-new-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🔬 New Features" title="Direct link to 🔬 New Features">​</a></h2>

<p>Apart of the parity release plugins included from the volatility3 framwework, the goal of VolWeb is to provide a different way to <strong>visualize</strong> data. We included the "Explore" feature for the Linux Memory Forensics investigation.</p>
<p>When clicking on the Explore tab, a graph is presented, listing the root processes nodes extracted from the Process Tree.</p>

<p>Several issues were addressed in this release</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MFTScan deactivation: This plugin is extracting the activies about the Windows Master File Tables updates. However, it is generating a LOT of events and was slowing down the analysis process, making the storage of the resulting JSON object sometimes impossible on too large dataset and making the server crash when fetching the Timeliner from the front-end. This amount of data was unexcepted and was polluting the timeline graph making the visualization less sharp. We also need to implement server side processing in order to display all of the data in the DataGrid (MUI Tables). This will take some time but it will greatly increase the performance of the application in time. <strong>Until this feature is available, we have disabled the MFTScan plugin and removed those artifacts from the Timeliner.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nginx frontend misconfiguration: A bug was identified in our nginx configuration resulting in 500 errors because of a internal rewrite redirecting to /dashboard/ instead of /.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-future-releases">🎯 Future releases<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/volweb-3-15#-future-releases" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🎯 Future releases" title="Direct link to 🎯 Future releases">​</a></h2>
<p>This release include new functionalities but Volatility3 2.26 comes with new dumping features that we want to include into VolWeb and enhance the visualization of some artefacts like Malfind. We also want to include suspicious process recon like done in Windows but for Linux, and fix the "BigData" issue faced with some plugins with server-side processing. Note that this project is currently done on my free time like all of the projects on ForensicXlab, so this will depend highly on my motivation. That's why we need your contributions ! Don't forget that we have a Discord server if you would like to talk directly to the community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<li><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thanatology part 2: Multiple disk images formats handling using the Exhume ToolKit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this blogpost, we will dive into the concepts of GPT and MBR partition schemes and explore them using <a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/docs/category/-exhume---partitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exhume Partitions</a>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="discovering-a-disk-image-layout">Discovering a Disk Image Layout<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-3#discovering-a-disk-image-layout" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Discovering a Disk Image Layout" title="Direct link to Discovering a Disk Image Layout">​</a></h2>
<p>In the last blogpost we presented how <a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/docs/category/-exhume---body" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exhume Body</a> is providing us with an easy way of reading sectors on multiple disk image formats. Now that we have this module, the next step when performing the digital forensic analysis of a disk image is to discover its layout.</p>
<p>In order for any computer to load an operating system when powering it up, the processor must locate and execute bootstrapping code stored in a well-defined location on the disk. This code is typically found in the Master Boot Record (MBR) for legacy BIOS systems or the GUID Partition Table (GPT) for modern UEFI-based systems.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/1-7ecbce5c156857ed6b6a473b3980db6f.svg" width="3015" height="1357" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>These structures define how the disk is divided into partitions. Partitions are simply set of logical segments that can each contain a filesystem. Proper partition analysis helps forensic investigators understand how the disk was used, identify hidden or suspicious partitions, and extract meaningful artifacts. It also provides context, such as whether the disk uses a standard layout or one that suggests tampering or obfuscation.</p>
<p>Understanding the partitioning scheme is critical as an investigator, as it determines how data structures are interpreted in subsequent analysis phases. Once the partition layout is identified, each partition can be parsed individually for deeper inspection of its filesystem contents. In the later blogposts of this series we will dive into a lot of filesystems like extfs, NTFS, exFAT, and more!</p>

<p>A bit of vocabulary so we are on the same page. In this blogpost and all of the others of this series:</p>
<p>A <strong>sector</strong> is the smallest addressable unit of data on a disk or other block storage device. Usually, a sector is <strong>512 bytes in size</strong>, though modern devices may use 4,096-byte (or 4K) sectors for improved efficiency. <strong>Unless specified, we will always use a 512 bytes size when mentioning sector size</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-master-boot-record-mbr">The Master Boot Record (MBR)<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-3#the-master-boot-record-mbr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Master Boot Record (MBR)" title="Direct link to The Master Boot Record (MBR)">​</a></h2>
<p>The Master Boot Record (MBR) is a special boot sector located at the very beginning of a storage device, typically the first 512 bytes (1 sector). It plays a crucial role in the booting process of legacy BIOS systems. The MBR consists of three main components: the bootloader code (usually the first 446 bytes), the partition table (the next 64 bytes), and a boot signature (the last 2 bytes, typically 0x55AA). The bootloader contains the machine code that initiates the process of loading the operating system. The partition table holds information about <strong>up to four primary partitions</strong>, including their type, starting sector, and size.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/2-c2d11f075e2d5e51d238c43a4084cdd7.svg" width="2214" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="partition-entries-in-mbr">Partition entries in MBR<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-3#partition-entries-in-mbr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Partition entries in MBR" title="Direct link to Partition entries in MBR">​</a></h3>
<p>As you can see, an MBR partition entry is 16 bytes long and describes one partition on the disk. The partition table in the MBR contains space for up to four partition entries, located between byte 446 and 509 of the 512-byte MBR sector. In MBR, a partition entry is composed of metadata providing the necessary metadata to the system in order to continue the booting process.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/3-eb916d7ba80e31db2fd75eec66fd6279.svg" width="2188" height="1250" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The boot indicator gives the information on whether the partition is bootable (active) with the value 0x80 or not bootable (inactive) with the value 0x00. Note that only one partition should be marked as active. Multiple active partitions should trigger your interest as a digital forensic investigator.
The Starting and Ending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder-head-sector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHS</a> Addresses are legacy special addresses used to locate the partition starting point. CHS stands for Cylinder-Head-Sector and is a legacy value divided into 3 bytes indicating the 3D coordinates and was used back in time when all disks were just a pile of cylinders with a head to read the data. It is very interesting to learn about CHS just to understand where all of those terms we are using are coming from.</p>
<p>Well, CHS is deprecated now, and the values you might find nowadays can be false because it’s deprecated. Instead, we know rely on the Logical Byte Addressing (LBA) metric. LBA is not a coordinate system but simply a linear numbering system to specify the location of (sectors) on a storage. In MBR the Start LBA is referring to the address of the beginning of the partition in sectors. A value of 0x800 means that the sector number 0x800  of the disk is the start of the partition. With this information we can compute the physical address in the entire disk in bytes as:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><i>Absolute Address = LBA x SizeOfOneSector</i></p>
<p>In our example, the absolute address of the beginning of our partition would be 0x800 * 0x200 = 0x100000.  But where does the partition ends? Well, instead of using the end CHS address that is deprecated, we use the sector count field which represent the number of sectors taken by the partition. We just have to multiply this value by the size of one sector, and we have the size in bytes of the partition.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><i>PartitionSize = SectorsCount * SizeOfOneSector</i></p>
<p>Another very important field is the <strong>partition type</strong> number. This number indicates the partition type or rather the "filesystem type". In MBR, each filesystem type is assigned to a unique value between (0x00 to 0xFF). Originally, in the 1980s and early 90s, the field had just a few defined values like 0x01 for FAT12, 0x04 for FAT16 As more operating systems and filesystems emerged (e.g., NTFS, Linux ext, swap, HPFS, etc.) new values were assigned which was still manageable. Eventually, third parties started overloading the values — meaning one type of code might refer to multiple possible formats. For example, the value 0x07 can be used for NTFS, HPFS, exFAT and QNX. Well this is a mess and in digital forensics we can use this field as an information but as this is not authoritative, we rely on partition identification validation using other methods that we will describe in the next blogpost of this series.</p>
<p>Finally, the MBR signature field. It occupies the last 2 bytes of the 512-byte MBR sector with the constant value of <strong>0x55AA</strong> (in hex) (or AA 55 as it appears in little-endian order in a hex editor). Just overwriting this field will lead to an unbootable system using a legacy BIOS. Malware authors can target the MBR when writing Wipers. Malware like  <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/whispergate-malware-corrupts-computers-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whispergate</a> is a real-world example that is overriding the MBR bootloader section with a custom code to display a ransom note and override the first 199 bytes of each partition entry found.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ebr-the-ugly-fix-for-the-partition-entries-limitation">EBR: The “ugly” fix for the partition entries limitation<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-3#ebr-the-ugly-fix-for-the-partition-entries-limitation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to EBR: The “ugly” fix for the partition entries limitation" title="Direct link to EBR: The “ugly” fix for the partition entries limitation">​</a></h2>
<p>If you followed everything until now, well first: congrats and thank you. Secondly, you noticed that the MBR is limiting the number of partition entries to 4. That is not enought nowadays as modern systems are using way more partition entries like dualboot systems, servers with multiple partitions to separate system functions, and more.</p>
<p>To counteract this, IBM and Microsoft introduced the Extended Boot Record. EBR is a special partition table that is pointed by a standard MBR partition entry and is holding metadata for one logical partition at a time. It follows a scheme very similar to MBR (with the same signature) and holds only 2 partition entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is describing a logical partition</li>
<li>The second one is describing the location of another EBR partition</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/4-ef49a87b2763d90ec2ba4d2be1cedc84.svg" width="3406" height="2246" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>With this method you can chain as many partition as you wish and “extend” the number of partitions you can fit into MBR. But this comes at the price of complexity and unused fields like the bootloader section of each EBR records. I haven’t been digging into research, but I guess letting these empty unused bootloader sections could be used by malware to hide malicious code in there. Might be worth investigating this possibility.</p>
<p>The MBR’s simplicity makes it widely supported, but also susceptible to tampering and limited in scalability compared to newer schemes like <strong>GPT</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="guid-partition-table-gpt-the-modern-layout">GUID Partition Table (GPT): The modern layout<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-3#guid-partition-table-gpt-the-modern-layout" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to GUID Partition Table (GPT): The modern layout" title="Direct link to GUID Partition Table (GPT): The modern layout">​</a></h2>
<p>The GUID Partition Table (GPT) is the modern partitioning scheme that replaces MBR, offering greater flexibility, scalability, and reliability. It was introduced as part of the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) standard, GPT supports disks larger than 2 terabytes and allows for an almost unlimited number of partitions (up to 128 by default, compared to MBR’s limit of 4 primary partitions). Unlike MBR, we will use the LBA metric to describe the structure. As a reminder, 1 LBA = 1 Sector = 512 (0x200) bytes in our blog post series context.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/5-e8e50d50624ee2091b04bf299c2ac447.svg" width="1944" height="1823" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="protective-mbr">Protective MBR<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-3#protective-mbr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Protective MBR" title="Direct link to Protective MBR">​</a></h3>
<p>The Protective MBR (PMBR) is a compatibility trick used in the in GPT to protect GPT disks from being misinterpreted by older, MBR-only tools. That’s why the GPT Header is located at LBA 1. The PMBR is non-bootable and has a partition type value of 0xEE with a start LBA address at 0x1 and a number of sectors equal to the entire disk (or 0xFFFFFFF if the disk is too large). Its whole purpose is to prevents MBR-only tools (like old versions of fdisk or BIOS utilities) from thinking the disk is unpartitioned and say “This is a GPT disk. Don’t mess with it.” It also gives us as a Digital Forensics Investigator the clue that we are dealing with GPT. We can also check the PMBR to see if it was corrupted or messed up with by a potential malware.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-gpt-header">The GPT Header<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-3#the-gpt-header" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The GPT Header" title="Direct link to The GPT Header">​</a></h3>
<p>The GPT Header is a 512-byte structure (typically) that sits at LBA 1 (right after the Protective MBR at LBA 0). It describes:
•	The layout of the GPT partition table
•	Where to find partition entries
•	How many partition entries exist
•	Redundant (backup) GPT structures</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/6-b1be6347a5427c2d87589a24a60f03ad.svg" width="2272" height="2758" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The GPT Header is very helpful in order for the Investigator to identify the partitions but if it was tampered with or corrupted, we can still rely on the fact that the backup information are still present at the end of the volume. We will see how we can do that with Exhume in a later section.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-gpt-partition-entries">The GPT Partition entries<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-3#the-gpt-partition-entries" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The GPT Partition entries" title="Direct link to The GPT Partition entries">​</a></h3>
<p>Each partition entry in GPT includes a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID), a partition name, and CRC32 checksums for integrity verification that make GPT more robust and resistant to corruption than MBR. It also has attributes that can give us more specific information about the kind of filesystem and operating system we are dealing with.</p>

<p>GPT is now the default partitioning method for Windows, Linux, and macOS on UEFI-enabled hardware. However you can and you will still find a lot of MBR.</p>

<p>We integrated MBR/EBR and GPT partition investigation capabilities into the Exhume ToolKit inside the "exhume_partitions" module. Let's see how you can investigate a disk image layout using the CLI.</p>
<p>After installing <a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/docs/exhume_partitions/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhume partitions</a>, we can view the different options we can pass to the program using the <code>--help</code> argument.</p>

<p>Let's investigate a corrupted GPT Disk Image. In this case the main GPT Header at LBA 1 is no longer available. On the screenshot bellow, we can see the GPT Signature that is suppoed to be "EFI PART" in ASCII was modified to corrupt it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/9-126e70f54fe8c3c99bd3852b14c0bfec.png" width="1260" height="732" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Exhume as the capability to try to parse the backup GPT header and entries if the LBA 1 metadata are corrupted. Let's witness it by using exhume_partition on this disk image.</p>

<p>We can see that the tool identified the PMBR, and didn't successfully parse the GPT signature. It as reverted to the backup Header thus making the parsing possible.</p>

<p>In this blogpost, we will dive into the concepts of disk images and how digital forensics examiners can use the <a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/docs/exhume" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exhume toolkit</a> to read data transparently from different formats. First, we will give an overview of what is a disk image and describe some of the existing formats one may encounter during a digital investigation. Next, we will explore how Exhume Body is providing an abstraction layer to those formats to read data agnostically.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="disk-images-in-digital-forensics">Disk images in digital forensics<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-2#disk-images-in-digital-forensics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Disk images in digital forensics" title="Direct link to Disk images in digital forensics">​</a></h2>
<p>A disk image is a <strong>complete</strong> copy of the contents of a digital storage device, such as a hard drive, solid-state drive (SSD), USB stick, CD/DVD, Virtual Machine, etc. It captures every bit of data stored on the device, including user files, system files, and even hidden or deleted information. In digital forensics, disk images are crucial because they allow investigators to preserve and analyze data without altering the original evidence. By working from an image rather than the actual device, forensic analysts ensure the integrity of the evidence is maintained, which is essential for legal proceedings and maintaining a chain of custody.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="logical-vs-physical-acquisitions">Logical Vs Physical Acquisitions<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology-2#logical-vs-physical-acquisitions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Logical Vs Physical Acquisitions" title="Direct link to Logical Vs Physical Acquisitions">​</a></h3>
<p>There are two primary types of acquisitions in digital forensics: <strong>physical acquisition</strong> and <strong>logical acquisition</strong>.</p>
<p>Physical acquisition involves creating a bit-for-bit copy of the entire storage device, including slack space, unallocated space, and hidden partitions. This type of acquisition is more comprehensive and enables deeper forensic analysis, such as recovering deleted files or analyzing remnants of previously stored data.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/diskimg1-b62b14a2d792b6378f871efbac2cdd5e.svg" width="1866" height="725" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><strong>Logical acquisition</strong>, on the other hand, captures only the files and directories visible to the operating system. While faster and less storage-intensive, logical acquisition may miss important data that resides outside the active file system, making it less thorough for forensic purposes.</p>
<p>Choosing between logical and physical acquisition depends mostly on the context of the digital forensic investigation case. However a chain of custody must be respected in each case, documenting the actions taken before, during and after the acquisition.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/diskimg2-3d37476d5f1d12126c19336781c9bc34.svg" width="2539" height="1479" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>When performing a full acquisition of a disk (whether it is a physical disk or an existing disk image from a Virtual Environnement for example without compression) you will always need to store the forensic copy on a storage device that possess at least the same storage capacity as the source disk copy you have to make. The storage capacity is increasing with the years which means the need to find ways to compress those images to be able to store more data was growing. That’s where some new disk image formats come into play.</p>
<p>Several disk image formats can be used digital forensic investigations, each with specific features and use cases. The most common formats include raw (dd), Expert Witness Format (EWF or. E01), and Advanced Forensic Format (AFF). The raw format is a simple sector-by-sector copy of the drive and is widely supported due to its simplicity and universality. However, it does not include metadata or compression which can be a bummer when facing situations with terabytes of data. EWF, developed by Guidance Software, is widely used in professional forensic environments because it supports metadata storage (like case number, examiner notes), compression, and integrity checks. If you are interested in EWF, we made a blogpost about it. AFF is an open-source format designed to be flexible and extensible while also supporting compression and metadata. The choice of format often depends on the tools available, the complexity of the case, and the need for efficient storage and documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Last but not least</strong>: the Virtual Disk Image formats like qcow, qcow2, vmdk , vdi, vhd or vhdx are used primarily for virtualization and emulation. Not all these formats come with compressions, but the layout is different for each and require parsing operations to obtain raw data sectors. Digital forensics examiner can also encounter such disk image format when seizing a virtual machine for example that is stored within the building of a cloud provider service. The difference (and sometimes advantage) when stepping upon such cases is that the disk image relevant for the case is already there, it functions just like a physical disk image would in a traditional forensic context. This allows to directly parse the file system, recover deleted files, analyze partition structures, and perform low-level searches without the physical disk extraction and digital copy phase. Virtual disk image also often has the capability of storing snapshots which can be very valuable for the investigator to be able to retrieve data that changed in time. If you are interested about those disk image formats, we made a <a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/vmdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blogpost about VMDK</a>.</p>

<p>When investigators deal with disk images in multiple formats, the main problem faced is compatibility and interoperability across forensic tools and workflows. Each image format has its own structure, metadata handling, compression method, and supported features, which can create significant challenges during analysis, validation, and evidence handling. The usual methodology to maximize compatibility is often to use tools and operations to convert those specific disk images into raw disk images that can later be ingested into forensics toolkits, but it can be time consuming and even generate data-loss.</p>

<p>Exhume Body is one of the core components of the Exhume Tool Suite. It is one of the foundation modules which is trying to provide an agnostic disk image data abstraction layer for file system forensics. It is providing a way to read and seek through multiple disk image formats like if it was contiguous sectors of data like a raw image. Exhume body is designed to understand these multiple disk image formats and to perform the parsing and potential decompression operations on the fly when requesting data.</p>

<p>Exhume Body is enabling the user to read and seek through data. Like most of the Exhume modules, the user can use either the command line interface or as a library.  Let us now show some practical examples.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/docs/exhume_body/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">installing exhume</a>, we can provide the tool with the location of the target disk image, the number of bytes to read and an offset.

<p>We can witness in the logs that exhume_body successfully retrieved the metadata about the EWF disk image and gave us the bytes we have requested. That is good if you want to dump some specific data from a specific offset to later analyse it in an other tool for example.</p>

<p>One use-case you might have the need to automate a specific parsing task from a disk image. If you are willing to program in rust (you should), you can use exhume_body as a library to perform the task you want. Here is an example.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After attending a conference for incident response teams, I joined a project aiming to create a forensic framework allowing acquisition and visualization of evidence from various sources: the Exhume toolkit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/docs/exhume" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Exhume Toolkit v0.1</a></p>
<p>In this quest of retrieving data from various base formats, I got involved in the understanding and implementation of a parser for the VMDK format.</p>
<p>The Virtual Machine Disk format has been created by VMware and is used by all kinds of virtual machines from all types of hypervisors. It is also used in exchange formats used to share virtual machines from one hypervisor to another.</p>
<p>Most IT experts, from cybersecurity to system administrators have heard of VMDK files. And I am no exception. But I never really understood what was behind this format. Sure, I did encounter some difficulties to access data from a VMDK file sourced from and ESXi server but I always found tools allowing to convert the file to a better suited format... Including VMDK itself.</p>
<p>At that moment I wondered why converting a VMDK file to another one could help me get access to the data for forensic purposes. And I've found the answer now I did some serious research on the matter.</p>
<p>The VMDK is not one file format by itself but rather a collection of formats depending on the configuration set up for the virtual machine. Many parameters can have an impact on the way the virtual machine data will be stored:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether the disk is thin provisioned or not</li>
<li>Whether the disk image is stored in a file, a full hardware disk or a partitioned disk</li>
<li>Whether the disk is divided in several files or not</li>
<li>Whether the data is compressed or not</li>
<li>Whether the file represents a snapshot or a full disk</li>
</ul>
<p>At the beginning, there is one thing in common for all formats: the descriptor file.</p>
<p>The descriptor file bears its name well and contains the metadata about a VMDK disk allowing to read and write data to the virtual disk.</p>
<p>It is a text description, usually in a separate text file, of various parameters related to the disk itself: disk ID, adapter type, but most importantly a list of references to what is described as extents.</p>
<p>Extents are the actual files, disks or partitions containing the data on the virtual disk. They can be of various forms determined by a parameter specified on each line.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.mickaelwalter.fr/content/images/2025/06/image-2.png" alt="" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Typical scenario of a descriptor file and its associated extents</p>
<p>A descriptor file can look like this:</p>

<p>The descriptor file above specifies a disk of type <code>2GbMaxExtentFlat</code>. This means that the disk is built around extent files of maximum 2GB that contain the actual data in a flat manner (the disk data is stored in a raw form). The extent description section will notably describe the number of sectors of 512 bytes for each extent and the start sector of the extent (here 2 097 152 sectors starting at sector 0).</p>
<p>So, we have a type for the disk as a whole and a type for each extent individually. It starts with a mess for newcomers, isn't it?</p>
<p>I won't dive in details on disk types. Mostly they will give a bit more details on the reasons extents are segmented in a certain way (in a single file or not, full disk, partition, etc.).</p>
<p>What interests me the most today is the way data is stored in the extents. Extents can also be one of several types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat : the data is stored as is in the file</li>
<li>Sparse : the data is stored in "grains" allowing to allocate only what's necessary</li>
<li>Zero : there is no data, just zeros (in this case, no extent path is specified)</li>
<li>VMFS : somewhat similar to flat but on ESXi servers</li>
<li>VMFSSparse : a sparse variant for ESXi servers</li>
<li>And others I won't dive in today</li>
</ul>
<p>The VMDK descriptor is usually in the <code>&lt;name&gt;.vmdk</code> file. Extents can be in other files such as <code>&lt;name&gt;-flat.vmdk</code>, <code>&lt;name&gt;-f001.vmdk</code>, or <code>&lt;name&gt;-s001.vmdk</code>.</p>
<p>Let's dive in the different extent types.</p>
<h1>Flat, VMFS and Zero</h1>
<p>Flat and VMFS extent types are basically the same type. They store raw data in the extent. That is, if you read data at byte 0 of the first extent, you will read the first byte of the virtual disk itself.</p>
<p>There can be some hiccups when the disk is segmented in several files in terms of how offsets must be handled (because the file is not starting at sector 0) but that's it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.mickaelwalter.fr/content/images/2025/06/image-3.png" alt="" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In the case of flat extents, data is stored sequentially and can be accessed by determining which sector must be retrieved. Knowing the sector number allows to determine the proper extent file and the proper offset inside the file itself</p>
<p>Flat and VMFS files cannot be thin provisioned and the combined size of such extents will be exactly the capacity of the disk with zeros located in places that have not been written yet. There is no header, no metadata including in the extents. Only the disk data.</p>
<p>Flat and VMFS files always have a separate plaintext descriptor file and are easy to identify through it as it is easy to open in a regular text editor.</p>
<p>The zero extent is only a virtual extent spitting out zeros.</p>
<h1>Sparse</h1>
<p>The sparse extent types appear when a disk is thin provisioned (when the size of the disk specified at the virtual machine creation is not fully allocated immediately).</p>
<p>The sparse extent files are binary files following a specific format. They start with the "KDMV" magic bytes (VDMK in little endian) and a header that will indicate the top-level metadata needed to read the file.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a sparse extent file is segmented in blocks of 512 bytes. As such, the header is 512 bytes long with padding to fill up the whole sector. All subsequent references in the file are specified in terms of sectors of this size.</p>
<p>There is a special case in <code>monolithicSparse</code> disks where the VMDK descriptor is not in a separate file but is embedded directly into the sparse extent file. In this case, the sparse file header will give the sector number where to locate the descriptor and the sector count it will take</p>
<p>The header of a sparse file contains a lot of metadata related to the way the data is organized. This is necessary because the disk contents are not organized sequentially.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.mickaelwalter.fr/content/images/2025/06/image-4.png" alt="" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h1>Overview of the structure of a sparse file</h1>
<p>To allow full understanding of this overview, we have to dive in the nature of a grain.</p>
<p>A grain is a group of sectors. The number of the sectors grouped in a grain is specified by a parameter in the header (it is usually set to 128).</p>
<p>So, in a sparse file the disk data is split in blocks of several 512-byte long sectors. Grains in which no data has been written are not provisioned (sparse grain) in the file and the corresponding entry in the grain table is set to 0 indicating that any byte retrieved from it should be 0.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the grain directory and the grain table.</p>
<p>The grain directory is a list of sector numbers pointing to various grain tables that can be placed anywhere in the sparse file. Each grain table will point to the first sector (relative to the start of the file and not the disk in this case) of the corresponding grain in the file.</p>
<p>In the grain directory and grain tables, grains are sorted in the same order as on the actual disk: the first entry of the first table pointed by the directory is the first sector of the disk part sliced in this sparse file (remember that a extent file does not necessarily start at sector 0 of the disk).</p>
<p>All the sectors of a provisioned grain are written fully in the file. A typical example of that is the sector 0 of a disk partitioned with a Master Boot Record. The MBR is usually 512-byte long. In this case, the grain 0 is provisioned and will contain data only in the first sector. All the other 127 (in case, the grain size is 128) are often set to 0.</p>
<p>The primary and secondary grain directories usually exist together to ensure resiliency in case of data corruption. Despite this, there are some cases where only the secondary directory should be used. A flag indicates which on to use depending on the case.</p>
<p>The file format explained before has 2 other variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>VMFS sparse: similar to the Sparse format but with several Copy-On-Write files</li>
<li>StreamOptimized sparse file: used in exchange formats such as OVA, this is a sparse file but with grain data compressed (using ZLIB DEFLATE)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first case, the file header format changes and contains more metadata allowing a root / children relationship between files.</p>
<p>In the second case, the file also contains markers that allow to read the file sequentially. It is still possible to refer to the data using the contents of the header rather than reading the whole file but it should be taken into account that a marker starts the grain and not the actual data. Moreover, even if when they are decompressed they have a fixed size, the compressed grains can be of variable length and may be the source of irregular repartition of grains in the file.</p>
<p>I won't dive into these special cases as they work on the same principles as the sparse extent type.</p>
<h1>Retrieving data for forensic purposes</h1>
<p>A challenge encountered by the forensic analyst when working with VMDK file is often to be able to retrieve the disk data in a reproducible and demonstrable way. Most forensic tools require a flat VMDK image to be able to work on the data. And you now see why this is the case.</p>
<p>However, flat images are not the norm as disks are most of the time thin provisioned to spare disk space on the host. This requires a conversion of the VMDK files to a monolithic flat one.</p>
<p>VMware (now Broadcom) provides such conversion tools but they are mostly closed source and there is no warranty of the integrity of data.</p>
<p>That's okay for most investigations but some require high levels of integrity.</p>
<p>In this case, the most sensible approach is to directly parse the original source without any attempt to convert it. This is the approach I used in my contribution to Exhume Body. It is not a complete coverage of all VMDK formats yet but feedbacks and samples will be useful for me to improve the module.</p>

<p>Don't hesitate to rise an issue or PR to improve this module.</p>

Built on top of the Exhume ToolKit (a modular set of Rust-based forensic tools), Thanatology combines performance, transparency, and modern design via a Tauri-based desktop interface.
Designed for law enforcement and digital forensic professionals, the project emphasizes not only artifact collection and presentation but will also try to provide help for interpretation.</p>
<p>For example, when analyzing EXTFS file systems, Thanatology will try to offers guidance on timestamp meanings and includes complete extraction details suitable for annexing to formal reports.</p>
<p>The blog series will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview of the Thanatology project and its goals.</li>
<li>A high-level introduction to the Exhume tool suite.</li>
<li>Deep dives into each Exhume module and its specific forensic use case.</li>
<li>Updates on the project development.</li>
<li>Interesting research techniques we found during our journey.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Thanatology is not intended to replace established tools, it will attempt to offers a modular and modern alternative ideal for cross-verifying findings or integrating into custom workflows. This blogpost series is mainly here to provide the community with updates, technical knowledge and any interesting subjects we found along the way.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="purpose-and-motivations">Purpose and motivations<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology#purpose-and-motivations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Purpose and motivations" title="Direct link to Purpose and motivations">​</a></h2>
<p>Working in the digital forensics field for a while now. I am amazed to witness many investigators using tools without being able to answer some critical questions in front of court, thus making the whole work sometimes worthless. Here are some critical questions that could pop up during review:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the artefact?</li>
<li>Where did it come from?</li>
<li>How was it acquired?</li>
<li>How was it processed or analyzed?</li>
<li>What does it mean?</li>
<li>Can this be independently verified and how?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although <strong>education</strong>, <strong>experience</strong>, and <strong>expertise</strong> are key to answer these questions, we felt that the need to have more control and transparency in the tool we use is critical.</p>
<p>With the intention to better understand what digital forensics tools are actually doing from scratch; I wanted to build my own tools. The trigger was during a criminology degree in 2024, I was introduced and dived deep inside the traditional medical forensics field and had the opportunity to witness how well the technical procedure is design for the study of the dead and the living. This gave me the motivation to create the “Thanatology” project named after this discipline<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology#user-content-fn-1-5450bf" id="user-content-fnref-1-5450bf" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> in an effort to create a framework that allows the digital investigator expert to be more rigorous by design.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-thanatology">What Is Thanatology?<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology#what-is-thanatology" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Is Thanatology?" title="Direct link to What Is Thanatology?">​</a></h2>
<p>In short, Thanatology is a modern and enhanced digital forensics Desktop Application which is cross-platform using the power of the Tauri framework.</p>
<p>It is built on top of the <a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/docs/exhume" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Exhume tool suite</strong></a> (or toolkit). The exhume tool suite is a set of command line and libraries written in rust from scratch to parse data from different digital sources and formats to extract artifacts. There is nothing new to the approach, the sleuthkit<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology#user-content-fn-2-5450bf" id="user-content-fnref-2-5450bf" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> is built around a similar philosophy.</p>
<p>The difference here is that I wanted to use the powerful capabilities of the rust language to produce an alternative and perhaps more modern approach to propose as many digital forensics features as possible like disk image forensics, memory forensics, malware analysis and, in time, Artificial Intelligence features.</p>
<p>It also allows me to compare my results with well-established tools and challenge myself technically. I could already witness during my journey some inconsistencies in some well-known and widely used tools that will be detailed in later blog posts. In short, rebuilding almost everything from scratch might sound time consuming and not interesting but it is worth it to learn new things and stimulate innovation.</p>

<p>The Thanatology project is built around 2 major components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Exhume Tool Suite</li>
<li>The Tauri Framework</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/docs/exhume" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exhume tool suite</a> (named after the exhume<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology#user-content-fn-3-5450bf" id="user-content-fnref-3-5450bf" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> terms in the discipline and the idea of bringing back from neglect or obscurity), is the foundation of the applications. Any digital forensics examiner can use the exhume tool suite as a command line to perform digital forensics investigation. Exhume is a hybrid tool suite, each tool can be used as a command line or as a library thus enabling any member of the community to write their own tools. Thanatology is just a Desktop application using the exhume tool suite as a library. <strong>We will deep dive into exhume in the next blogpost of this series</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-tauri-framework">The Tauri Framework<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology#the-tauri-framework" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Tauri Framework" title="Direct link to The Tauri Framework">​</a></h3>
<p><em><strong>Digital Forensics is a cross-platform discipline!</strong></em></p>
<p>Tauri is a modern framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Frontend: Web technologies (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)</li>
<li>A Backend: Native Rust code</li>
</ul>
<p>It allows developers to package their web-based UI as a lightweight, secure desktop application across Windows, Linux, and macOS. In our case, we choose the REACT MUI framework for the frontend.</p>
<p>Unlike Electron (which bundles Chromium), Tauri uses the system’s native webview (WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS, and WebKitGTK on Linux), making it much smaller and more secure.</p>
<p>There is many more advantages in using the tauri framework you can learn more <a href="https://tauri.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the context of Thanatology, Tauri allows seamless reuse of the exhume tool suite code in the desktop app. This ensures high performance, memory safety, and low-level control without sacrificing UX.  We are using a local SQLite database for the first major release, but the goal is to have an hybrid approach where the use can choose between a local or remote database, enabling collaboration.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="state-of-the-art">State of the art<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology#state-of-the-art" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to State of the art" title="Direct link to State of the art">​</a></h2>
<p>Thanatology is in its development phase, it is evolving in parallel of the Exhume toolsuite, exhume being the library which the projects is relying up on. We are starting with traditional disk forensics and currently have made several millstones described below.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="basic-case--evidence-management">Basic case &amp; evidence management<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology#basic-case--evidence-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Basic case &amp; evidence management" title="Direct link to Basic case &amp; evidence management">​</a></h3>
<p>In Thanatology, a case is a set of evidence. The investigator can create a case and add one or multiple evidence linked to the created case. The type of evidence supported is currently only “disk image” which can be a logical or physical acquisition.</p>
<figure style="border:1px solid #888;padding:20px"><img src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/img/thanatology-1/Picture2.png" alt="Thanatology evidence selection view"><figcaption><i>Thanatology evidence selection view</i></figcaption></figure>
<figure style="border:1px solid #888;padding:20px"><img src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/img/thanatology-1/Picture3.png" alt="Thanatology case summary view"><figcaption><i>Thanatology case summary view</i></figcaption></figure>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mbr--gpt-partition-discovery">MBR &amp; GPT Partition Discovery<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology#mbr--gpt-partition-discovery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to MBR &amp; GPT Partition Discovery" title="Direct link to MBR &amp; GPT Partition Discovery">​</a></h3>
<p>Once the evidence is selected, the preprocessing of the evidence can begin. The preprocessing phase is meant for the investigator to choose what he wants to analyze. It is important in the case of disk forensics for example that the investigator knows exactly what was discovered and that the action can be replicated with the exhume tool kit command line. You can see below the difference between discovering partitions in the Exhume toolkit with the CLI versus the output produced in the desktop application. That show how interlinked the twos are. Our philosophy is: “<em><strong>What you can see in the Desktop application can be recovered using the CLI</strong></em>”.</p>
<figure style="border:1px solid #888;padding:20px"><img src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/img/thanatology-1/Picture4.png" alt="Thanatology partition discovery view"><figcaption><i>Thanatology partition discovery view</i></figcaption></figure>
<figure style="border:1px solid #888;padding:20px"><img src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/img/thanatology-1/Picture5.png" alt="Exhume partition discovery view"><figcaption><i>Exhume partition discovery view</i></figcaption></figure>
<p>The investigator can choose which partitions he wishes to analyze. Thanatology is transparent and will inform the investigator if it is not capable of parsing some types of partitions. In the example below, we selected the Linux/GNU partition, which is recognized by Exhume, however the swap partition is not yet supported by any modules, thus indicating this information to the user. We plan to add the capability to choose which investigation modules to run in the processing phase so the investigator can disable or enable some modules depending on the context.</p>
<figure style="border:1px solid #888;padding:20px"><img src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/img/thanatology-1/Picture6.png" alt="Exhume partition discovery view"><figcaption><i>Thanatology partition discovery view</i></figcaption></figure>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="basic-extfs-and-ntfs-file-indexing">Basic ExtFS and NTFS file indexing<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/thanatology#basic-extfs-and-ntfs-file-indexing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Basic ExtFS and NTFS file indexing" title="Direct link to Basic ExtFS and NTFS file indexing">​</a></h3>
<p>The next step after the <strong>preprocessing</strong> phase is the processing phase. This is where the investigator will start the processing of the evidence. We build a basic file discovery module to index each file inside the local database. We have implemented a filesystem normalization system in exhume. This system is inherited by Thanatology. The advantage is that we can build the Exhume tool suite with the Thanatology application in mind to guide us.</p>

<p>When the processing is done, the last stage is to review it to perform our digital investigation. The current design is only for demonstration purpose and will evolve in time but here is a sneak peak into the features we would like to provide for the first release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artifacts category navigation</strong>: Preselect some known artifacts base on the digital forensic community.</li>
<li><strong>Simple and deep file introspection</strong>: We are developing our own “Advanced File Viewer” to introspect files in real time.</li>
<li><strong>Agnostic shell integration</strong>: Many investigators like to use the command line to run their own tools or the Exhume toolkit as a command line in the evidence they are investigating. We are integrating the capability to pop shells in Thanatology like you would in visual studio code for example.</li>
<li><strong>Whiteboard</strong>: The investigator can keep track of the story he is building around the case using the Whiteboard which is based on <a href="https://plus.excalidraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">excalidraw</a>.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Windows executable analysis is a key aspect of Digital Forensics and Reverse Malware Engineering. Identifying the capabilities of a program can help to target potential malicious code and orient the later reverse code analysis phase. In this blogpost, we will dive into the structure of the Windows Portable Executable (PE) and how we can extract the imported functions in the context of memory analysis.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="windows-pe-format">Windows PE Format<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/voliat#windows-pe-format" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Windows PE Format" title="Direct link to Windows PE Format">​</a></h2>
<p>A portable executable (PE) <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/voliat#user-content-fn-1-efcee2" id="user-content-fnref-1-efcee2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> is a file format used by Windows to store executable programs, libraries (DLLs) and object files. It contains all the necessary information for the operating system to load and execute the program. The program is therefore well structured. Here is a representation of the PE structure for a Windows system <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/voliat#user-content-fn-2-efcee2" id="user-content-fnref-2-efcee2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/1-daca747f861ae57a39ac6507d382ad44.png" title="PE Structure (simplified)" width="318" height="558" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The PE starts with the well-known DOS, Stub and NT headers. It is also composed of multiple sections. Each section as its own purpose, for example the .text section contains the byte codes corresponding to the instructions of the program. We will see that there are specific sections that exists which might help the analyst to identify the capabilities of an executable without starting the reverse code analysis phase. If you want to learn more about the PE format, the articles from 0xRick about the subject are very well explained <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/voliat#user-content-fn-2-efcee2" id="user-content-fnref-2-efcee2-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interactions-with-the-memory">Interactions with the memory<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/voliat#interactions-with-the-memory" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Interactions with the memory" title="Direct link to Interactions with the memory">​</a></h3>
<p>In the context of memory analysis, we need to understand what is happening when a Windows executable is loaded. The operating system will map the PE file from the disk to memory by first creating a dedicated virtual address space. Then, the headers are parsed and loaded to learn about important information about the sections (entry point, size, ...). Once parsed, the memory allocation is performed to load the actual content of the sections. The PE file often depends on external libraries, the operating system resolves the imports by looking up the required functions in the corresponding DLLs and update the memory addresses accordingly. A library can be “bound” to the PE which means it is directly integrated inside the code section. This is often used for better performances.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-import-address-table-iat">The Import Address Table (IAT)<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/voliat#the-import-address-table-iat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Import Address Table (IAT)" title="Direct link to The Import Address Table (IAT)">​</a></h3>
<p>The Import Address Table is located inside the “.idata” Section <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/voliat#user-content-fn-3-efcee2" id="user-content-fnref-3-efcee2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> of a PE, it can be seen as a table of references indicating to the loader which functions are needed from the imported DLL by the program. This table is a copy of the Import Lookup Table (ILT), but once in memory, the IAT is overwritten with the actual addresses of the functions that are being imported which is interesting from the memory forensics standpoint.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="extracting-the-iat-using-volatility3">Extracting the IAT using volatility3<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/voliat#extracting-the-iat-using-volatility3" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Extracting the IAT using volatility3" title="Direct link to Extracting the IAT using volatility3">​</a></h2>
<p>Carving the IAT during memory forensics can be very valuable for the analyst to look for API call patterns associated with malware behavior. For example, the OpenProcess, VirtualAllocEx, CreateRemoteThread function present inside the IAT of a PE can be a good indicator for potential code injection <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/voliat#user-content-fn-4-efcee2" id="user-content-fnref-4-efcee2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>. The analyst can also pivot on some of the functions to identify for example the arguments that can be passed.</p>
<p>A volatility3 plugin can be made to extract the IAT information from the memory. Below is an example output of the created plugin named “windows.iat.IAT”. For each process, the associated PE sections are parsed in order to find the IAT. Next, all of the imported functions are displayed to the analyst as well as if the associated DLL is bounded or not to the executable.</p>

<p>The extraction of the IAT can be very useful for the analyst to identify the capabilities of a process in memory and gather context to better orient the reverse code analysis phase. When the analyst is willing to understand some of the Windows API functions, the Microsoft documentation is often explaining everything <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/voliat#user-content-fn-5-efcee2" id="user-content-fnref-5-efcee2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>. Trying to look for some of the functions in the text section and extracting the value of the arguments can be the subject of a future blogpost.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Windows executable analysis is a key aspect of Digital Forensics and Reverse Malware Engineering. Identifying the capabilities of a program can help to target potential malicious code and orient the later reverse code analysis phase. In this blogpost, we will dive into the structure of the Windows Portable Executable (PE) and how we can extract the imported functions in the context of memory analysis.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-master-file-table">The Master File Table<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/volads#the-master-file-table" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Master File Table" title="Direct link to The Master File Table">​</a></h2>
<p>Forensic analysts utilize the MFT extensively as it provides a wealth of information during investigations. Every file or directory in an NTFS volume holds an entry in the MFT. Each MFT entry, also known as a record. By examining the MFT, one can acquire valuable insights into a system's file activity, including deleted files or folders, timestamps, and access permissions. This information can be used to determine which files were created, accessed, modified, or deleted, and when these actions occurred for example.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-mft-records">The MFT records<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/volads#the-mft-records" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The MFT records" title="Direct link to The MFT records">​</a></h3>
<p>MFT entries or records are typically 1,024 bytes in size and are divided into several fields. Here is a very nice representation by Jaked Atinkson of an MFT record.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/mftfilerecord-e4ce1712bb2c8229c41d79242b53edb4.png" title="MFT Record" width="1600" height="1219" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Header:</strong> Holds information about the record itself, such as its address and links to other records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File Attributes:</strong> Reveal crucial details about the file or directory, including its name, timestamp, size, and permission. File attributes may either be resident, meaning they are stored directly within the MFT record, or non-resident, indicating that they are stored elsewhere on the disk with only a reference in the MFT entry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>$DATA</strong> attribute typically contains the actual contents of the file, the data can be <strong>resident</strong> or <strong>non-resident</strong>.</p>
<p>A resident $DATA attribute means that the data is stored directly within the MFT record. This is usually the case for small files, where the data can fit within the record. The data will be stored directly in the MFT entry along with the metadata. Whereas a non-resident $DATA attribute is present when the file is too large for the record and therefore will contain a pointer to the location on the disk where the data is actually stored.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alternate-data-streams-ads">Alternate Data Streams (ADS)<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/volads#alternate-data-streams-ads" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alternate Data Streams (ADS)" title="Direct link to Alternate Data Streams (ADS)">​</a></h3>
<p>NTFS is providing a feature called <strong>alternate data stream</strong> (ADS). Used by Windows, it consists of another stream of data that can be attached to a file without changing its size or content.</p>

<p>One example of usage of this feature by Microsoft is the <strong>Zone.Identifier</strong> ADS. It is employed by Internet Explorer and other Windows applications to identify where a file was downloaded from and from a potentially unsafe zone (like the internet). This artefact is known to be very useful for forensics investigators. But it was also seen in the wild that some threat actors are abusing the ADS to hide malicious payloads. The ADS can be detected by the fact that a given record is holding multiple $DATA attributes.</p>

<p>Even if the MFT entries are stored on disk, the latter also cached in memory, which motivated the creation of the “MFTScan” volatility3 plugin. This plugin is scanning for $STANDARD_INFORMATION and $FILE_NAME attributes providing a view of the files that were present in the volatile memory of the target system.</p>

<p>A new addition the capabilities of the MFT analysis in memory would be to scan for ADS inside the records looking for others $DATA attributes that are resident. This plugin was therefore created to detect ADS and extract the resident data to present it to the analyst. The output shows the file associated with the ADS found as well as a Hexdump and disassembled view. The latter could potentially help an analyst to identify a malicious code.</p>

<p>The ability to scan for Alternate Data Stream is a good way to identify whether a file was downloaded from the internet or not. One can also identify malicious hidden data to help analysts upon an investigation to shed light onto the attack chain.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Digital Forensics ecosystem, the field of memory forensics can help uncover artifacts that can’t be found anywhere else. That can include deleted files, network connections, running processes, rootkits, code injection, fileless malware and many more.</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced the hibernation feature in Windows 2000, allowing systems to be powered down while preserving their volatile state. This is achieved by saving RAM contents and processor context to a file called hiberfil.sys before shutting down inside the root folder of the filesystem drive. When the computer is turned on again, the system restores the volatile state from the saved file. Hibernation files are valuable for digital forensic professionals as they store temporary data from RAM to non-volatile storage, eliminating the requirement for specialized tools on the target device.</p>
<p>The Hibernation file structure has evolved in time. In this blog post, we will dive into the structure of the modern Windows hibernation file and propose a new translation layer for the volatility3 framework to create a raw memory image from a hibernation file.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-structure-of-a-modern-hibernation-file">The structure of a modern hibernation file<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/hibernation#the-structure-of-a-modern-hibernation-file" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The structure of a modern hibernation file" title="Direct link to The structure of a modern hibernation file">​</a></h2>
<p>The structure of the hibernation file can be divided into two variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>From Windows XP to Windows 7 (old)</li>
<li>From Windows 8 to Windows 11 (modern)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following image represent the modern structure.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/1-724f00b186f3fc6032dc7c20875e1f64.png" title="Structure" width="3585" height="5621" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In this blog post we will focus on the modern hibernation structure<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/hibernation#user-content-fn-1-602a43" id="user-content-fnref-1-602a43" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>, though you’ll notice that the underlying principle remains the same which is to compress and store the physical memory pages of the hibernated system in specific data structures called “restoration sets”.
 </p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-file-header">The file header<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/hibernation#the-file-header" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The file header" title="Direct link to The file header">​</a></h3>
<p>The hibernation files start with a header called PO_MEMORY_IMAGE. The structure of this header may differ slightly depending on the operating system version, but its definition is publicly available in the kernel's debugging symbols, which is very nice. The vergiliusproject<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/hibernation#user-content-fn-2-602a43" id="user-content-fnref-2-602a43" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> gives us a nice description of this structure for each Windows version. Below is an example of the structure of the header.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/2-5829bdfa225b7b984b67e4f53f213111.png" title="Header" width="1139" height="1059" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The signature of the file for an exploitable hibernation file is ‘<em>HIBR</em>’. The ‘<em>RSTR</em>’ signature indicates that the system is resuming from the file, making it apparently useless when this is the case. Valuable forensics artifacts are available like the system time when it was put into the hibernation state.</p>
<p>Notice the “<strong>FirstBootRestorePage</strong>” and “<strong>FirstKernelRestorePage</strong>” attributes. Those values are storing the page number of the first restoration sets. Mutiplying those values by the size of a Windows x64 page (4096) we get the offset of the sections.</p>
<p>Windows currently divide the storage of the memory pages in 2 locations :</p>
<ul>
<li>The boot section.</li>
<li>The kernel section.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You might notice the “SecureRestorePage” section, however this value seems to be always 0 and there is no publicly available explanation on what those pages are used for. It might be used in the future though to encrypt memory pages so only the host machine can decrypt them via its TPM?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To know how many pages are stored for each sections the information can be retrieved from specific attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>"<strong>NumPagesForLoader</strong>": The number of pages in the "Boot" section</li>
<li>"<strong>PerfInfo-&gt;KernelPagesProcessed</strong>": The number of pages in the "Kernel" section</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately for us, the attribute storing the location and number of pages for the Kernel section did change with the Windows OS updates. Below is a table tracking those changes.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Windows Versions</th><th style="text-align:center">FirstKernelRestorePage  offset</th><th style="text-align:center">KernelPagesProcessed offset</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Windows 8/8.1</td><td style="text-align:center">0x68</td><td style="text-align:center">0x1C8</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 10 2016 1507-1511</td><td style="text-align:center">0x70</td><td style="text-align:center">0x218</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 10 2016 1607</td><td style="text-align:center">0x70</td><td style="text-align:center">0x220</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 10 2016 1703 - Windows 11 23H2</td><td style="text-align:center">0x70</td><td style="text-align:center">0x230</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>A restoration set contains multiple <strong>compression sets</strong>. Each compression set contains a header structure giving information about how many page descriptors it contains, the compression algorithm used and the size of the compressed concatenated pages of the set.</p>
<p>The compression algorithm used can be one the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>None: the pages are stored uncompressed</li>
<li>Xpress: The pages are stored using the Microsoft Xpress LZ77 Algorithm <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/hibernation#user-content-fn-3-602a43" id="user-content-fnref-3-602a43" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></li>
<li>HuffmanXpress: The pages are stored using the Microsoft Xpress LZ77+Huffman Algorithm <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/hibernation#user-content-fn-3-602a43" id="user-content-fnref-3-602a43-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/hibernation#user-content-fn-4-602a43" id="user-content-fnref-4-602a43" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>All the page descriptors are located after the header and are describing where the pages reside in the decompressed data.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="creating-a-volatility3-translation-layer">Creating a volatility3 translation layer<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/hibernation#creating-a-volatility3-translation-layer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Creating a volatility3 translation layer" title="Direct link to Creating a volatility3 translation layer">​</a></h2>
<p>To be able to read multiple memory image formats, the volatility3 framework is using what’s called “Translation Layers”.  Each layer in volatility3 focuses on a particular aspect of memory forensics, such as parsing specific data structures, analyzing various kinds of artifacts, or understanding specific evidence formats. The layers can be seen as individual building blocks that can be stacked on top of each other in a specific order to build the right context before extracting data for analysis. As an example, a memory image with the "vmem" format will induce the stacking of the "VmwareLayer" to be able to read such file format and extract memory pages.</p>
<p>In our case, when the framework is requesting several bytes at a specific physical address, it needs to understand the structure of the hibernation file and how to extract the right pages. For this, we have to indicate to the framework for a given memory “segment”, the corresponding set of pages.</p>
<p>The Hibernation layer role is to provide the volatility framework with the following information :</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the file header to see if the layer needs to be stacked (check the signature to verify it is a hibernation file)</li>
<li>Build a list of segments: A segment is here to translates a given physical address to an offset inside of the uncompressed data of the relevant compression set.</li>
<li>Provide the decompression method for a given segment: Our layer needs to be able to decompress a given compression set and returns the number of bytes requested by the upper layer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those two algorithms were implemented and added to the volatility3 framework codecs without the needs of using the Windows API via cstruct (making this layer OS independant). Those algorithms are well documented but python3 is not really the best programming language to perform bitwise operations. Thus the developpement of those two algorithm took time to make sure that the decompressed page using our implementation is giving the same result as the native API <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/hibernation#user-content-fn-5-602a43" id="user-content-fnref-5-602a43" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup></p>

<p>After implementing this new translation layer, it was time to test it against multiple hibernation files. Knowing that we need to do a lot of decompressions operations, the hibernation layer is meant to be combine with the “layerwriter” plugin to create a raw memory image and then analyze it with the windows plugins. Indeed, the decompression of a set takes time and most of the plugin need to scan the entire memory dump pages making a lot of decompression operations thus slowing the framework. Creating a raw memory dump first is the best approach here for performances. To this end, 2 new plugins were added to the volatility3 framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>windows.hibernation.Info</strong> : Display the basic information about the hibernation file and if it seems exploitable.</li>
<li><strong>windows.hibernation.Dump</strong> : Convert the hibernation file into a raw memory dump (based on the layerwriter plugin)</li>
</ul>
<p>The generation of the raw memory file was performed on 8 hibernations files from different versions of Windows:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Version / Target</th><th style="text-align:center">hiberfile size</th><th style="text-align:center">Conversion time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Windows 8 x64 / Laptop</td><td style="text-align:center">8GB</td><td style="text-align:center">~30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 10 1507 x64 / Laptop</td><td style="text-align:center">8GB</td><td style="text-align:center">~20 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 10 1607 x64 / Laptop</td><td style="text-align:center">8GB</td><td style="text-align:center">~20 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 10 1809 x64 / KVM</td><td style="text-align:center">8GB</td><td style="text-align:center">~10 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 10 1809 x64 / KVM</td><td style="text-align:center">4GB</td><td style="text-align:center">~5 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 10 22H02 x64 / Laptop</td><td style="text-align:center">8GB</td><td style="text-align:center">~60 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 10 22H02 x64 / Laptop</td><td style="text-align:center">16GB</td><td style="text-align:center">~100 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Windows 11 23H02 x64 / Laptop</td><td style="text-align:center">8GB</td><td style="text-align:center">~100 minutes</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><strong>Note :</strong> On Windows 1809 hiberfile from a KVM, it was found that pages were located only in the boot section and none in the kernel section. The compressed data were either using the Xpress LZ77 compression or were not compressed but the Huffman variant was not identified. On Windows 22H2, most of the pages are located inside the kernel section using both plain LZ77 and LZ77+Huffman compression. It is not clear how Microsoft decides which compression algorithm is used and if both sections are used to store the pages.</p>

<p>For all tested files, the framework was able to extract and decompress all of the pages in each restoration sets. The hibernation layer <strong>currently only support Windows 8 x64 to Windows 11 23H2 x64 hibernation files</strong>. Windows server hibernation analysis was not tested yet but it will come in time. Hopping the forensics community will also test this new addition and give some feedback to improve this layer. You can find the feature here: <a href="https://github.com/forensicxlab/volatility3/tree/feature/hibernation-layer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/forensicxlab/volatility3/tree/feature/hibernation-layer</a>.</p>
<p>Hoping this article will bring back the interests of the Digital Forensics community to hibernation files which are very valuable when available.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Chad Tilbury @chadtilbury who gave me the motivation to dive into this project and the team of researchers behind the Hibernation file structure analysis (Joe T. Sylve, Vico Marziale, Golden G. Richard III).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Memory forensics is a huge help when performing an investigation and during incident response. Collecting memory images and analyzing them at scale is a challenge.</p>
<p>It is crucial to have the capability of examining memory images on storage platforms other than traditional file systems. With the emergence of cloud technologies, new forms of storage known as object storage have emerged. Enabling memory analysis on object storage provides exciting opportunities for innovation and advancement.</p>
<p>In this article, we will go through the journey of making the volatility3 framework compatible with s3 object-storage to perform memory analysis over the network. Also, the reader will discover how this new capability can and will be applied to the VolWeb 2.0 project which is still in developpement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Disclaimer :</strong> All of the information about the volatility3 framework given in this blogpost are from my own understanding of the framework and of the project documentation<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/vols3#user-content-fn-1-a3ad40" id="user-content-fnref-1-a3ad40" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>.

<p>Object storage is a type of data storage architecture that manages data as objects, rather than as blocks or files like traditional storage systems. In object storage, a unique identifier is assigned to each piece of data and stored in a flat address space. These objects can contain not only the data itself, but also metadata and other attributes that provide additional information about the object. One of the key features of object storage is its scalability and it is ideal for storing big data sets like digital forensics evidence for example.</p>

<p>The native volatility3 framework currently provides one method for accessing data when performing the contextualization on a memory image which is direct access on a traditionnal filesystem.</p>
<p>When an analyst is using volatility3 to extract data using a plugin, the framework is building the context "behind the scenes", which is the most critical step in the memory forensics workflow aside from the aquisition and analysis steps. This step is too often overlooked/forgotten by some investigators.</p>
<p>In the framework, the data contextualisation is made via "layering" and "stacking".
Each layer in volatility3 focuses on a particular aspect of memory forensics, such as parsing specific data structures, analyzing various kinds of artifacts, or understanding specific evidence formats. The layers can be seen as individual building blocks that can be stacked on top of each other in a specific order to build the right context before extracting data for analysis. As an example, a memory image with the "vmem" format will induce the stacking of the "VmwareLayer" to be able to read such file format and extract data.</p>
<p>One of the layer is called the "FileLayer" or "physical". One of the usage of this layer by the framework is to know how to locate, open, read and overall access resources of the evidence provided by the investigator. The FileLayer is using what is called a "ResourceAccessor" to interface with the physical evidence.</p>

<p>The FileLayer currently support one type of resource accessor which is the <strong>file://</strong> and <strong>http(s)://</strong> url patterns. They are used to read the evidence and remote pdb files by using the urllib python3 library.</p>
<p>By giving the possibility to the analyst to indicate that the evidence as to be read from remote object storage we can pass this information to the context and create an other resource accessor.</p>

<p>Here is what was done to make this possible :</p>

<p>One can ask what are the potential applications after these new additions to the framework.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Remote investigation: Memory forensics can be performed on object storage without requiring physical access to the device hosting the storage. This allows for remote investigations, making it more convenient and efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scalability: Object storage over the network offers scalability, allowing the storage capacity to be expanded easily when dealing with large data volumes. This is particularly useful when performing memory forensics on extensive datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved Collaboration: By conducting memory forensics on object storage accessible over the network, multiple IT specialists and forensic experts can collaborate on the investigation simultaneously. This promotes knowledge sharing and enhances the chances of identifying critical evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory Acquisition at scale : One can script memory acquisition and deploy evidence collection on multiple system by storing the result into an On-Premise solution like Minio or in a cloud solution like AWS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No third party installation : Some people don't like to have "agent-base" solutions installed on their assets to perform memory forensics. Once the evidence are acquired, memory forensics will be performed on a dedicated environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To conclude, the goal of this addition to the volatility3 framework is to give more capabilities to digital investigators and incident responders when performing memory forensics. The fork of the project implementing this feature is available for you to review the code : <a href="https://github.com/forensicxlab/volatility3/tree/feature/bucket-s3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/forensicxlab/volatility3/tree/feature/bucket-s3</a> .</p>
<p>Like all solutions, there are downsides to remote memory forensics. Indeed performing remote memory forensics will have an impact on performances and the investigator need to choose wisely about the solution used. However with cloud-computing network performances, network memory forensics can be very efficient. In a futur blogpost, a concrete application of remote memory forensics will be demonstrated by introducing VolWeb 2.0 which is still in development at the time of writing of this article.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Video games have become an integral part of our culture, providing entertainment and social opportunities. Unfortunately, criminals have also begun to take advantage of modern video games and their ever-growing capabilities to conduct illegal activities. Organized crime, hate spread, and pedophilia have been documented occurring within games, opening up the potential to a world of cybercrime.</p>
<p>Digital forensics on the Steam application can be especially useful for law enforcement in tracking down and prosecuting these cybercriminals. By investigating video game applications like Steam, digital footprints that can be used to link individuals to games, transactions, and even other players. Once these links are established, they can then used to build a case against the perpetrators. In this article, the reader will learn about some artifacts that can give releavant information left on a disk during a post-mortem analysis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note :</strong> All of the information about the investigated user displayed in the following findings are redacted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A dedicated web browser is built into the Steam software (the Steam application is just another derived version of chromium). It can even be accessed while playing in game. It is a convinient way for gamers to look for something online without quitting the game. Therefore, interesting artifacts can be retrieved in the same way a digital forensics investigator would do when performing a Chrome analysis.</p>

<h1>Miscellaneous: Friends, Installed games, Playtime and game sessions</h1>
<p>As a digital forensics investigator, you might be interested about the Steam friends of the user you are investigating, the games he played and for how long.
All of the Steam users and games have unique IDs used to talk to the servers and get various information.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="steam-user-account-information">Steam user account information<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/steam#steam-user-account-information" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Steam user account information" title="Direct link to Steam user account information">​</a></h2>
<p>The user has two assigned unique IDs :</p>
<ul>
<li>The Steam ID : Used to identify a profile on the Steam community website.</li>
<li>The account ID : Used to link the account to other various information (subscription, owned games,...)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first ID is always the account ID of the user you are investigating (the user is friend with himself). Next, all of his friends are listed alongside with their ID.</p>
<p>To recover more information about the user's friend one may use the following request :</p>
<p><a href="https://steam-chat.com/miniprofile/ACCOUNT_ID/json/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://steam-chat.com/miniprofile/ACCOUNT_ID/json/</a></p>
<p>This request has to be made online; it is usefull to see if the user changed his informations when performing the post-mortem analysis.</p>
<p>With this, the investigator will be able to confirm :</p>
<ul>
<li>The user's friend name (may have changed  when performing the post-mortem analysis)</li>
<li>Retrive the profile picture (can be great to build a graph).</li>
</ul>

<p>Making a similar request with the Steam app id, one can retrive the metadata about the installed game to make better user profiling:</p>

<p>The remote client cache can tell us about the hostnames and public IP adresses that were recently used to connect to Steam (via browser or desktop application). It might be possible to even guess the operating system that were used if some default naming conventions were used. In the bellow example, we can guess that the source OS is probably Windows.</p>

<h1>What about the user conversations ?</h1>
<p>Unfortunately the user conversations are not saved on disk but on the Steam's servers. The channel used to send messages is encrypted through a socket using X509 certificates. You might be able to get those by collaborating with the Steam organization if you are law enforcement. It might be possible to retrieve conversations in the web browser cache or by using memory analysis though I did not dig into any of these hypotheses yet.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>To conclude this article, we were able to retrieve a good amount of information about the user. Those artifacts were found from my own research, there might be more interesting artifacts that were missed when preparing this blog article. If you are looking to automate your artifacts collection, a python library <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/steam#user-content-fn-2-ffd9e8" id="user-content-fnref-2-ffd9e8" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> exists to parse vdf files.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On May 1st, 2023, vdhoney<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/keepass#user-content-fn-1-8d99df" id="user-content-fnref-1-8d99df" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> raised concerns about a flaw he found impacting KeePass 2.X.<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/keepass#user-content-fn-2-8d99df" id="user-content-fnref-2-8d99df" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. Vdhoney claimed to be able to reconstruct the master password from memory.
A POC <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/keepass#user-content-fn-3-8d99df" id="user-content-fnref-3-8d99df" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> was later released by the researcher not only in dotnet but also in python3<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/keepass#user-content-fn-4-8d99df" id="user-content-fnref-4-8d99df" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Today in this blog post we will describe the vulnerability and see how we can create a volatility3 plugin to help forensics investigators to retrieve passwords from memory.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vulnerability-description">Vulnerability description<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/keepass#vulnerability-description" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Vulnerability description" title="Direct link to Vulnerability description">​</a></h2>
<p>The vulnerability (CVE-2023-32784 <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/keepass#user-content-fn-5-8d99df" id="user-content-fnref-5-8d99df" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>) resides in the basic KeePass version 2.X written in .NET. This version utilizes its own custom-made text box named SecureTextBoxEx, not only for the master password entry dialog but also in other parts of the program such as password edit boxes. Though this use case is not likely to be used by users as it is a bad practice, it should be noted that the flaw does not cover the scenario where the master password was copied from a clipboard.
From this observation, Vdohney built up a method to recover that scattered information from memory. Indeed, this text box produces left over strings when a password is entered. For example, when “Hello” is typed, the following strings remain present in memory “•e, ••l, •••l, ••••o”. One can find more details about this vulnerability on vdhoney’s github <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/keepass#user-content-fn-3-8d99df" id="user-content-fnref-3-8d99df-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>As a forensics investigator, you might have actual (or past) cases where KeePass 2.X process activities were retrieved. Using volatility3, it is possible to list the running processes using the “pslist” or “psscan” plugin.</p>

<p>In this example we can see that the KeePass process was running on the host machine. The PID retrieved is “752”.
Using volatility3, one can dump this process layer and retrieve all the sections linked to the virtual address spaces. Once completed, one can map virtual pages to physical pages and extract the residing data.</p>
<p>A custom plugin allows to parse the data to isolate the relevant patterns (in this case “●”) seeking to further attempt the reconstruction of the master KeePass password entered by a user. The plugin can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/forensicxlab/volatility3_plugins/blob/main/keepass.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/forensicxlab/volatility3_plugins/blob/main/keepass.py</a></p>
<p>By passing the PID of the process to the volatility3 KeePass plugin, one can try to reconstruct the master password:</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/keepass#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>To conclude this article, we demonstrated that the reconstruction of a master password of Keepass can be implemented into volatility3 framework via a custom plugin. The discovery of new memory extraction techniques is helping the field of digital forensics and specially law enforcement agencies that are now able to access memory from devices in a more efficient and non-destructive way. This methodology could be valuable in solving actual incident cases, including past ones where the memory was retrieved and stored and keepass master password remained unbroke.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a digital forensic expert, proving the authenticity and reliability of a forensic image in court is essential. Indeed, the integrity of the data needs to be maintained during the imaging process, preventing any accidental or intentional modification of the data.
The Expert Witness Compression Format (EWF) provides a way to store metadata about the image, such as the source device, imaging tool, checksums, signatures, and other relevant information about the acquired media. This imaging format main feature is its compression capability thus reducing the size of the resulting image file. Compression allows for faster analysis of the data and reduces storage requirements.
This article is meant to vulgarize the structures behind an EWF Segment. The reader will discover the main algorithms to use in order to be able to read and seek inside such image format. Finally, a proof of concept writen in rust will be shared to the reader.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="filesystem-layers-of-abstraction">Filesystem layers of abstraction<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#filesystem-layers-of-abstraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Filesystem layers of abstraction" title="Direct link to Filesystem layers of abstraction">​</a></h2>
<p>Before getting right into the main subject of this article, it is important to learn or get a little reminder about the filesystem concepts, vocabulary, and the underlying layers of abstractions.
Let us take the Unix filesystem concept as an example. Below is a vulgarized representation of the main layers of abstraction.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/1-7a939b608e6c8f0b9b010d3f93415301.png" title="Filesystem layout" width="1198" height="721" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>A storage medium (hard drive, SSD, …) have the necessary set of electronics to create an abstraction of the Logical Block Addressing. It can be viewed as contiguous sequence of sectors. A sector is the smallest accessible unit on a drive (typically 512 bytes for disk drives).  It is possible to create a group multiple sectors and form a block.  Blocks are the smallest accessible units on a filesystem.  Each filesystem type can have their own concepts to represents files, directories, hardware devices etc...
The exploitation system is supplying the abstraction of those human friendly concepts via the kernel to perform various actions on the filesystem (read, write, seek...).</p>
<p>Digital forensics is performed on a copy of the media to be investigated. This can be done with various tools (FTK Imager, EnCase, dd, Falcon, others…) and produce an image that can have various format (raw, img, ewf, vmdk, vdi…) to be analyzed later without performing the investigation on the original media.</p>
<p>From a forensics perspective, when a storage media is acquired, the investigator needs to find a way to emulate all the necessary abstraction layers in order to extract specific artifacts usefull to an investigation without tempering with the data. Forensics tools are providing such abstraction and capabilities. Most of those tools support different image format. One of these formats is well known and largely used: the Expert Witness Compressing Format (EWF).</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-expert-witness-compression-format">The Expert Witness Compression Format<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#the-expert-witness-compression-format" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Expert Witness Compression Format" title="Direct link to The Expert Witness Compression Format">​</a></h2>
<p>The Expert Witness Compression Format (EWF) is a forensic image output format created by the ASRDATA company. It can be used to create a bit-by-bit copy of a digital device. It includes both data and metadata, such as the partition table and other information about the device. EWF is designed to maintain the integrity of the original data and can be compressed to reduce storage requirements. It is widely used to preserve evidence for analysis and investigation both by law enforcement, digital forensics and incident response companies. This format is not so easy to understand because it is a proprietary file format, thus the purpose of this blog article. Luckily, the opensource community provide a C library and a nice documentation about this file format <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#user-content-fn-1-ff8942" id="user-content-fnref-1-ff8942" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>. Let’s try to have a nice mental representation of the components of an EWF image.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-segments">The segments<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#the-segments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The segments" title="Direct link to The segments">​</a></h3>
<p>An EWF image can be divided into multiple segment files (there can also be a unique segment file). Those segments files have a consecutive extension system: Starting from “E01” to “E99”, then in alphabetical order from “EAA” to “ZZZ”. Dividing a large sized media evidence source into multiple segments is a great way to prevent a large and unique raw output file that can sometime creates problems on some filesystem. Each segment file is composed of a <strong>Header</strong> and multiple <strong>Sections</strong>.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-ewf-file-header-and-sections">The EWF file Header and Sections<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#the-ewf-file-header-and-sections" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The EWF file Header and Sections" title="Direct link to The EWF file Header and Sections">​</a></h4>
<p>Let’s now dive into the components of a EWF segment file.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/3-a08894ef23d4821517f6987ecdfe9c8f.png" title="EWF structure" width="1490" height="843" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The EWF is storing the source evidence image’s sectors inside <strong>chunks</strong>. A chunk is just a group of sectors. There is a finite number of chunks per segments. Therefore, the information about the sectors and chunks needs to be known if we want to read them.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-segment-file-header">The segment file Header<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#the-segment-file-header" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The segment file Header" title="Direct link to The segment file Header">​</a></h4>
<p>Each segment file has a <strong>Header</strong> (do not confuse the <strong>segment file header</strong> with the <strong>section header</strong> described later). The file header contains a signature (or a magic number) of 8 bytes that attest of its format:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/4-8f3978b8f737aaa54a501a75624be5a3.png" title="Header" width="1108" height="636" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In this example, the signature is: “EVF\0x09\0x0d\0x0a\0xff\0x00”</p>
<p>The file header also contains the information about the <strong>first section offset</strong> and the segment number.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-sections">The sections<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#the-sections" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The sections" title="Direct link to The sections">​</a></h4>
<p>The sections are the metadata of the image used by the tools to be able to read the evidence sectors and get other various information about the acquired evidence (checksums, acquisition tool used, timestamps etc…). Each section starts with metadata describing itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its type (header, volume, …)</li>
<li>Its size</li>
<li>The next section offset</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is what important information you can extract from each section:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The header section -</strong> Not to be confused with the segment file header described earlier, it contains information about the acquired media (case number, Evidence Number, Examiner name, etc.). Each acquisition tools have their own way of describing what information reside in this section.</li>
<li><strong>The “volume” or “disk” section –</strong> It contains critical information about the sectors and the chunks of the acquired media that will help the investigator to parse the EWF file like the chunk count, the size of a chunk, the size of a sector, the number of sectors per chunk.</li>
<li><strong>The sector section –</strong> It contains the actual chunks of the acquired evidence. Now, the main advantage about EWF is that some of the chunks can be compressed to gain space on the destination storage using the zlib compression algorithm. Therefore, we need to know what the offsets of each chunk are and if it is compressed chunk or not.</li>
<li><strong>The table section –</strong> This section is like a table of pointers that will tell the investigator where to find each chunk and if it is compressed. The most significant bit (MSB) of each pointer indicates if the chunk is compressed (1) or uncompressed (0).</li>
<li><strong>The “end” or “next” section –</strong> The “end“ section indicates that this segment file was the last one. However, the “next” section indicates that there is another segment to parse.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can now understand better the image showed at the beginning. To have more details about each section, the libewf project is providing a good documentation <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#user-content-fn-2-ff8942" id="user-content-fnref-2-ff8942" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Now that you have a better understanding of this file format, you want to be able to write a code to create the abstraction layer needed to read data like a standard disk and beginning the extraction of evidence.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-1-parsing-all-the-useful-metadata-from-each-segment">Step 1: Parsing all the useful metadata from each segment.<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#step-1-parsing-all-the-useful-metadata-from-each-segment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: Parsing all the useful metadata from each segment." title="Direct link to Step 1: Parsing all the useful metadata from each segment.">​</a></h4>
<p>First, we want to be able to read chunks, we first need to extract all the necessary metadata about those chunks from each segment. To hold all the important metadata, we can create multiple structures to store them. Here is an example of what you can do.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/5-92d8558c343bb21817ff54253852bcf9.png" title="EWF structure" width="1421" height="896" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Here, the purple color corresponds to a Structure or an Object. The red color represents an HashMap or a Dictionary with a key and a value. The blue color is a vector. You’ll notice that we have created the structures representing the different headers and sections of an EWF Segment. Our main goal is:</p>
<ul>
<li>To know where all the segment file descriptors are. (segments)</li>
<li>To store all the chunk for each segment (chunks).</li>
<li>To store all the end of sector offset for each segment (end_of_sectors).</li>
<li>To know what is the current chunk that the EWF structure points to (CachedChunk).
To understand better here are the structure definitions of a Chunk and a CachedChunk:</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that this function is calling other parsing functions and data structures that I did not describe in pseudo-code. The main goal is to understand the main parsing routine.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-2-read-an-arbitrary-chunk">Step 2: Read an arbitrary chunk.<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#step-2-read-an-arbitrary-chunk" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 2: Read an arbitrary chunk." title="Direct link to Step 2: Read an arbitrary chunk.">​</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have save all our chunks, we can create a function to read the chunk number <strong>X</strong> from the given segment number <strong>Y</strong>.</p>
<p>Reading a chunk includes checking if it is a compressed chunk. And if so, decompressing its data before.</p>
<ol>
<li>To read the data from a chunk number in a segment file here are the steps to follow :</li>
<li>Check if the given chunk number is valid for the given segment using the “chunks” dictionary in our EWF structure. If not, it raises an error.</li>
<li>Use the following variables:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>data: An empty buffer of bytes to store the read data.</li>
<li>chunk: A reference to the chunk object in the segment.</li>
<li>start_offset: The starting position in the segment where the chunk data is located.</li>
<li>end_offset: The ending position in the segment where the chunk data is located (for compressed chunks).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Seek to the starting position of the chunk data in the segment.</li>
<li>If the chunk is not compressed, read data from the segment into a buffer.</li>
<li>If the chunk is compressed, decode the compressed data using Zlib <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#user-content-fn-4-ff8942" id="user-content-fnref-4-ff8942" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> and store the result in the data buffer.</li>
<li>Return the data buffer containing the chunk data.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can now read the data from any chunk number in a given segment!</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-3-create-a-standard-read">Step 3: Create a standard read<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#step-3-create-a-standard-read" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 3: Create a standard read" title="Direct link to Step 3: Create a standard read">​</a></h4>
<p>Now the last step is to create a read function to imitate the traditional read system call <sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/ewf#user-content-fn-3-ff8942" id="user-content-fnref-3-ff8942" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> on a POSIX system. To perform this task here are the steps for a given number of bytes to read:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if there is any cached chunk data available. If not, read the first chunk of the first segment and set it as the cached chunk data.</li>
<li>Loop until the size is zero.</li>
<li>If the remaining size of the data to be read is less than or equal to the remaining data in the cached chunk, update the buffer with the remaining data. Then update the cached chunk pointer and size.</li>
<li>If the remaining size is greater than the remaining cached chunk data, update the buffer with all the remaining cached chunk data and calculate the remaining size of the data to be read.</li>
<li>Check if there are more chunks to be read or if the end of the segments has been reached. If there are more chunks, get the next chunk number and read that chunk's data.</li>
<li>Otherwise, return the buffer that has been read so far (nothing more to read).</li>
</ol>

<p>To conclude this blogpost, we were able to create the abstraction layer needed to read an EWF image. We can now identify partitions and create other abstraction layer to read files, reconstruct a system tree etc… This can be the subject of future blogposts.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malware analysis is very useful when performing a digital investigation. Indeed, identifying how a malware works and determining its behavior is very useful to detect future attacks, other compromised equipment, make critical choices and discover new TTPs. In this blog article, we will dive into the behavioral analysis of the latest QBOT campaign using malicious OneNote documents as an initial vector to compromise a host and deploy stealers. This article will demonstrate a use case of VISION-ProcMon for behavioral analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This blog post is not a complete analysis of the sample but simply demonstrate the capabilities of the tool.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="behavioral-analysis-using-vision-procmon">Behavioral analysis using VISION-ProcMon<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/vision#behavioral-analysis-using-vision-procmon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Behavioral analysis using VISION-ProcMon" title="Direct link to Behavioral analysis using VISION-ProcMon">​</a></h2>
<p>For this example, we are performing the analysis of a malicious OneNote document extracted from a phishing email linked to one of the latest QBOT campaign in February 2023. When performing the behavioral analysis of this malicious document, the analyst is usually setting up a lab with tools to record the activities of the system while the malicious activities are performed to analyze them latter. Using the Procmon tool from the Microsoft’s sysinternals, we can capture all the activities of processes running on the victim machine on demand.</p>
<p>If we launch the capture and execute the malicious OneNote document, we will have the details about the processes involved in the infection. When saving the result, we can choose to save the result as a CSV document.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/7-563e579662c64d056c29dc72bbc191b1.PNG" title="Vision filtered" width="1802" height="1043" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Once our export has been made, we can launch VISION-ProcMon and enter the full path of the file to load.

<p>Once our export has been made, we can launch VISION-ProcMon and enter the full path of the file to load.

<p>We can see that the <strong>ONENOTE</strong> process launched the mshta.exe process which is a legitimate Microsoft process used to execute web content outside of a web browser. It can be used to execute JavaScript, VBScripts and other compatible web technologies. In this case we can see that following this process execution, two new processes are created: curl.exe and rundll32.exe which is very suspicious. Before pivoting to those processes, we can check what are the files and registry keys the mshta.exe process interacted with.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/5-93042d81c1a8f4d7ff1c6494539347eb.png" title="Vision filtered" width="1387" height="907" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>First, we can see that the process read the <strong>Open.hta</strong> file which is in the context of this malware analysis is the malicious HTA executed.</p>
<p>Next, we can witness the creation of the malicious registry key <strong>MP3Conv</strong>. Then the <strong>MP3Conv\Cfg</strong> value is set. In the context of the malware analysis, the malicious HTA is saving an encoded javascript function inside this registry key which is then executed. We can also see that the configuration is later deleted to clear tracks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/9-8fab180c775fecf0faa9502937cc17bf.png" title="Vision filtered" width="1448" height="1008" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Let’s pivot to the curl.exe process which is the next step after executing the malicious script. The command line associated is interesting because it contains the command used to fetch a malicious DLL on a C2 server disguised as an image.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/3-23cc2ae45db4b3e393c57dd23eb01643.png" title="Vision filtered" width="1381" height="847" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Finally, the script ends by executing the malicious DLL through the rundll32.exe process. We can pivot on the process and witness the command line associated to the execution.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/4-3f31888c683f51ce61f7867a5d26f9ec.png" title="Vision filtered" width="1381" height="847" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>VISION-ProcMon is a tool to help the malware analyst in his investigation. This means that it must be used in conjunction with other malware analysis tools (static, dynamic, …). It is also a great way to complete your malware analysis reports by illustrating your explanations with visual examples. You can find the tool here : <a href="https://github.com/forensicxlab/VISION-ProcMon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/forensicxlab/VISION-ProcMon</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When performing incident response, the adversary often uses legitimate remote access software as an interactive command and control channel.
AnyDesk<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/anydesk#user-content-fn-1-026302" id="user-content-fnref-1-026302" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> is one of those software being extensively used as a sublayer of persistence by threat actors or access other servers in the environment via RDP<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/anydesk#user-content-fn-2-026302" id="user-content-fnref-2-026302" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.
The latter has been often encountered in the wild in the past years as a preferred tool leveraged by known threat actors.</p>
<p>As such, Anydesk should be closely monitored as threat actors could easily alter or delete data after a successful attack; sometimes it is not possible to restore those altered logs. Defending against malicious actions with such remote software can be even more intricate for organizations having approved its legitimate usage.
Here we propose to leverage memory forensics to retrieve and analyze artefacts thanks to a custom Volatility plugin that I made available as a free open-source tool for improving digital investigations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Conti AnyDesk installation tutorial</strong></em></p>
<p>A striking example came out the last year upon leaked manuals of Conti’s ransomware-as-a-service operators dedicated to its affiliates with pentesting skills<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/anydesk#user-content-fn-3-026302" id="user-content-fnref-3-026302" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>.  From this case we can learn how the tool was installed by the attacker using PowerShell.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we will cover which files linked to anydesk are useful and how valuable it can be upon an investigation. Eventually, in the case where an intrusion set is deleting those files using an anti-forensics technique, a volatility3 plugin will be proposed to retrieve that information, which might still reside in memory.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="anydesk-trace-files">AnyDesk trace files<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/anydesk#anydesk-trace-files" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AnyDesk trace files" title="Direct link to AnyDesk trace files">​</a></h2>
<p>When using Anydesk, specific files<sup><a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/anydesk#user-content-fn-4-026302" id="user-content-fnref-4-026302" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> are written to trace the activity of the application. There are two files of particular interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>ad.trace</li>
<li>ad_svc.trace (only at installed version)</li>
</ul>
<p>On a windows 10 machine, you can respectively find those files in the <code>%APPDATA%\AnyDesk\</code> and <code>%SYSTEMROOT%\ProgramData\AnyDesk\</code>.
Here is an example of data you could find within the log file:</p>

<p>We can see that it is possible to extract useful artifacts.
Hereby is a non-exhaustive list:</p>
<ul>
<li>AnyDesk version</li>
<li>The IP address of the AnyDesk relay used when initiating a connection</li>
<li>Timestamps of each action</li>
<li>Listening port</li>
<li>Incoming connection IP address</li>
<li>Involved PIDs</li>
<li>Number of monitors found</li>
<li>Install date</li>
</ul>

<p>If the adversary is aware of those artifacts, he might delete those files. However, there is still a chance to retrieve those cached files in memory!
In this example, our is setup is 2 windows 10 virtual machine (<strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>). <strong>A</strong> (attacker) is initiating a remote anydesk connection to <strong>B</strong> (victim).
After a while the session is disconnected and A deleted the ad.trace and ad_svc.trace files.
Next, a memory dump of machine <strong>B</strong> is performed, ready to be analyzed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Look for ad.trace and ad_svc.trace using the filescan plugin;</li>
<li>Try to dump the files if found;</li>
<li>Parse the files and render the data to the investigator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, we could just dump the file and analyze it offline. However, writing a dedicated plugin is useful to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interface with the Timeliner plugin and make timestamps correlation with other artifacts;</li>
<li>Interface with any other tools that are exploiting the other volatility3 output capabilities (json, csv, ...).</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The filesystem is one of the most basic and important concepts in UNIX/Linux. This concept is working around the idea that “everything is a file”, meaning that the hardware, regular files, directories, sockets, kernel data structures, process communications etc are represented as files with their own types. On a filesystem, a file (whatever its type) is assigned with a number called an "<strong>inode</strong>". An inode is an interface between the blocks on the filesystem and the file.</p>
<p>When a process is running, it is interacting with the hardware, the kernel, the user’s resources etc, therefore opening the required files. Linux is keeping track of the opened files inodes in memory by using the <strong>Virtual File System</strong> (VFS) and more precisely the <strong>directory entry cache</strong> (dentry). In this article, I will present how you can extract inode metadata from a modern Linux memory image using the volatility3 framework.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="linux-memory-analysis">Linux memory analysis<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/inodes#linux-memory-analysis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Linux memory analysis" title="Direct link to Linux memory analysis">​</a></h2>
<p>When performing memory forensics on a Linux memory image, the fact that a lot of distribution exist is making the memory analysis with volatility3 trickier. Volatility3 is basically trying to identify known structures in memory to create python objects that can be exploited. The framework needs <strong>symbol tables</strong> to be able to know where to find these structures and how they are defined. For example, to identify the structures inside a x64 Intel based Linux Debian machine memory dump, you'll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>To find the kernel debugging symbols generated at compilation time matching the kernel version.</li>
<li>Convert the debugging symbols into symbol tables understandable by volatility3.</li>
<li>Work with the framework to identify and extract structures from memory and get your artifacts.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can learn more about theses steps here : <a href="https://volatility3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/symbol-tables.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://volatility3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/symbol-tables.html</a></p>
<p>This process is easier for Windows and Mac because there is "one distribution" per OS. However, the fact that a lot of distributions for Linux exists makes this task more difficult.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="inode-forensics-value-in-memory">Inode forensics value in memory<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/inodes#inode-forensics-value-in-memory" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Inode forensics value in memory" title="Direct link to Inode forensics value in memory">​</a></h2>
<p>If you have ever performed digital forensic on a post-mortem Linux investigation, you may know that the inode structure on disk varies depending on the type of filesystem used. For example, Debian is by default using <strong>ext4</strong> filesystem whereas Fedora is using <strong>XFS</strong> and CentOS is using <strong>btrfs</strong>.</p>
<p>However, the fact that we are performing our analysis in memory, we are talking about extracting inode objects contained in the <strong>directory entry cache</strong> (dentry) from the <strong>Virtual File System</strong> (VFS). The VFS is an abstraction of the filesystem within the kernel which allows coexistence between the different type encountered. The fact that dentries are living in RAM and are never saved to the disk is giving us new useful forensics artifacts that may not be found on a classic “dead system”.</p>
<p>When a process is opening files, it is storing a list of file descriptors. Each file descriptor (fd) is a pointer to a structure containing the dentry cache. We can extract the file inode from this structure and get access to its metadata which are very useful forensics artifacts. We can retrieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>File size in bytes (i_size)</li>
<li>File permissions (i_mode)</li>
<li>Last modification time (mtime)</li>
<li>Last changed time (ctime)</li>
<li>Last access time (atime)</li>
</ul>

<p>To be able to extract inode metadata from memory we can identify those major steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through each process using the <strong>pslist</strong> plugin.</li>
<li>For each process, extract the list of file descriptors using code from the <strong>lsof</strong> plugin.</li>
<li>For each file descriptor, extract the cached dentries, parse the inode metadata and return the result.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the plugin is extracting all of the inode metadata needed to help us during our investigation (we like timestamps !).</p>

<p>To conclude, this plugin is a good way to an in depth understanding of how a Linux kernel is storing files in memory and what are the information you can extract from a Linux memory acquisitions.  This plugin was tested on a Debian with kernel version <strong>5.10.0.18-amd64</strong>. The plugin is available on the forensicxlab github repository: <a href="https://github.com/forensicxlab/volatility3_plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/forensicxlab/volatility3_plugins</a>.
You should identify each steps described before in the source code comments.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Windows prefetch files are temporary files stored in the <strong><code>%SystemRoot%\System\Prefetch</code></strong> folder. This memory management feature is keeping track of the frequently running applications on a given system. We can extract some data from those files in order to get useful information for a digital forensic investigation. In this blog article, I will explain how we can use memory forensic to extract prefetch files, parse them and create in the end a volatility3 plugin.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="windows-prefetch-file-format">Windows Prefetch file format<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/prefetch#windows-prefetch-file-format" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Windows Prefetch file format" title="Direct link to Windows Prefetch file format">​</a></h2>
<p>Windows prefetch files are constructed with one file header and multiple sections. In each sections different information can be found in which there can be some interesting valuable forensic artifacts. With the evolution of the Windows versions, prefetch files format changed we will see later those changes and the differences between them. Integers are stored in little-endian order, Strings in UTF-16 little-endian and Timestamp in Windows FILETIME UTC. You can see bellow a representation of a prefetch file header and how the information is stored:</p>
<div style="background-color:white;align-items:center"><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/screenshot-e4464d35f4c066cc4d3d266964b3db4a.png" title="Prefetch header" width="786" height="330" class="img_ev3q"></p></div>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="format-version">Format version:<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/prefetch#format-version" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Format version:" title="Direct link to Format version:">​</a></h3>
<p>For the different windows versions, the prefetch format version is different:</p>
<ul>
<li>17 (0x11) - Windows XP, Windows 2003</li>
<li>23 (0x17) - Windows Vista, Windows 7</li>
<li>26 (0x1a) - Windows 8.1</li>
<li>30 (0x1e) - Windows 10</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="signature">Signature:<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/prefetch#signature" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Signature:" title="Direct link to Signature:">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>SCCA - Windows XP to Windows 8.1</li>
<li>MAM – Windows 10/11</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="original-executable-name-and-hash">Original executable name and hash:<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/prefetch#original-executable-name-and-hash" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Original executable name and hash:" title="Direct link to Original executable name and hash:">​</a></h3>
<p>The two information are present in the header but are also present in the prefetch filename stored on the disk (ExecutableName.EXE-Hash).pf. The hash is use to differentiate multiple execution of the same executable.</p>
<p>Now that we have the header information, we can extract other artifacts from the file information sections.</p>
<p>For each different file version, the prefetch file information are not located at the same offset. Here is the interesting information we can find about the executable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Section A, B, C, and D offset and entries information – Useful to locate our artifacts</li>
<li>Last Execution - Latest execution time of the executable.</li>
<li>Execution Counter – How many times the executable was run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of those information are located at different offsets. Depending on the file version, those offsets are not the same. You can find for each version the associated offsets <a href="https://github.com/libyal/libscca/blob/main/documentation/Windows%20Prefetch%20File%20(PF)%20format.asciidoc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-mam-signature">The MAM signature:<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/prefetch#the-mam-signature" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The MAM signature:" title="Direct link to The MAM signature:">​</a></h3>
<p>SCCA signature indicates that the file information is stored in plain text whereas the MAM signature indicates a compressed prefetch file. MAM Signature are present in Windows 10 and 11 prefetch files only and needs to be decompressed before it can be read. The compression method used is called XPRESS Huffman which is a Microsoft compression algorithm. We’ll see later the python3 implementation of this algorithm used for the volatility3 plugin.</p>
<p>If you are doing forensic on a hard drive, you probably know the Windows Prefetch Parser tool by Eric Zimmermann. However, there is no tool extracting prefetch file artifacts from memory. To this end, we are now going to see the extraction and parsing of prefetch files with volatility3.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="volatility3-prefetch-plugin">Volatility3 Prefetch plugin<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/prefetch#volatility3-prefetch-plugin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Volatility3 Prefetch plugin" title="Direct link to Volatility3 Prefetch plugin">​</a></h2>
<p>To be able to extract the prefetch file and parse them from a memory dump, we need to go through theses major steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan for prefetch files using the “filescan” plugin;</li>
<li>Dump each prefetch file in a bytearray;</li>
<li>Identify each Prefetch signature and decompress it if necessary (MAM signature);</li>
<li>Parse the Prefetch and extract the interesting artifacts;</li>
<li>Render the result.</li>
</ul>
<p>When developing the plugin, I had to implement the Microsoft's XPRESS Huffman decompression algorithm in python3 to be able to read Windows 1.X prefetch files. I have used the provided Microsoft pseudo code of the algorithm available . The python3 implementation of the algorithm itself is available on the forensicxlab's github : <a href="https://github.com/forensicxlab/Xpress_LZ77Huffman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/forensicxlab/Xpress_LZ77Huffman</a> The volatility plugin is using a derived version of this algorithm, which will return the file even if the PF is incomplete so we can extract information.</p>

<p>The plugin was tested on Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 vmem memory dumps. The plugin code can be found on the forensicxlab's github and will be submitted to the volatility3 community for a potential integration to the framework.

<p>From there, we can start our investigation on the memory image using the left panel (clicking on the "Plugins" button). From the displayed menu named "Case", we have the information we need to answer question <strong>#2</strong> about the SHA256 value of the RAM image which is : <strong>9db01b1e7b19a3b2113bfb65e860fffd7a1630bdf2b18613d206ebf2aa0ea172</strong></p>

<p>Let's try to find what tool were used to dump the memory of this machine and at the same time, identify the PID of "brave.exe" to answer question <strong>#1</strong> &amp; <strong>#3</strong>. For this we are going to go through the process tree graph.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/2-14215d392ee1b6bb5a91e82fa46e80d2.png" title="PSTree" width="970" height="464" class="img_ev3q">
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/3-977eec9fd985c1193517ad591d214d4c.png" title="PSTree" width="958" height="751" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Using this plugin, we immediately have the process ID of brave.exe which is 4856 and thus, is the answer for question <strong>#3</strong>. If we look deeper into the tree we can also spot "FTK Imager" which is a known forensic tool that can be used to dump memory from a live system.</p>
<p>To answer question <strong>#1</strong>, we need to find the time at which the RAM image was fully acquired. For this, I like to use the timeline plugin. It's always good to take a look at the timeline to take a step back and have a good view of the activities registered on the machine in time. We can try to identify the time at which the memory dump was finished by looking for the FTK Imager activities. We know that when the dumping procedure is finished, we have no more information registered, which means we need to identify the last event timestamp recorded.</p>
<p>Looking at the timeline, we find the following :</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/4-b74cf91df1136ecb2bb9cae11391e9f4.png" title="PSTree" width="1743" height="323" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This timestamp <strong>2021-04-30 17:52:18</strong> is the latest identified. By looking at the cyberdefenders challenge, we know that the last digit of the answer is "19" which is one second greater than our result. The answer for question <strong>#1</strong> is indeed 2021-04-30 17:52:19.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="network-analysis">Network analysis<a href="https://www.forensicxlab.com/blog/cb-brave#network-analysis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Network analysis" title="Direct link to Network analysis">​</a></h2>
<p>To answer question #4, we can use the netscan and the netstat plugin. By using the search bar, we can look for the key word "ESTABLISHED" and count how many connections are identified : For this question, the "netstat" plugin is returning 10 connections marked as ESTABLISHED, and only 9 connections for the "netscan" plugin. The answer for question <strong>#4</strong> is indeed <strong>10</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/5-06fdbf953c2fe41621118d7178caa6f2.png" title="PSTree" width="1445" height="620" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>For the next question, we are looking for a FQDN that the chrome process established a connection with. By looking at the IP contacted by the chrome processes, we can extract some public IP addresses.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/6-03cccc2a9bfb95efc77487014be420bf.png" title="PSTree" width="605" height="385" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Using the tool of your choice, you can search for the FQDN linked to IP addresses we have found. To conclude, the domain is <strong>protonmail.ch</strong>, which is the right answer for question <strong>#5</strong>.</p>
<p>The next question is asking us the MD5 hash value of process memory for PID 6988. For this one, we are going to look for the process using the "Process" tab and look at the left panel to dump our process and calculate the signature.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/7-c6b2029ad2d4b5b162fc3f405999a79c.png" title="PSTree" width="285" height="243" class="img_ev3q">
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/7.1-ee6bbd501fedc73d6b941cd481739c31.png" title="PSTree" width="1242" height="43" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Then answer for question <strong>#6</strong> is indeed <strong>0b493d8e26f03ccd2060e0be85f430af</strong>.</p>
<p>For the next question we need to go fetch the word starting at offset 0x45BE876 with a length of 6 bytes in the memory dump. We can write a simple python3 script to do this.</p>

<p>The answer is indeed "<strong>hacker</strong>" for question <strong>#7</strong>.</p>
<p>Question <strong>#8</strong> is pretty straight forward, just go back to using the ProcessTree plugin and fetch the PPID of "powershell.exe".</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/8-fbd628376fd5a2f03acebec5b34b2d75.png" title="PSTree" width="770" height="752" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>For question <strong>#9</strong>, we need to investigate to find the full path and name of the last file opened in notepad. The CmdLine plugin is the way to go for this question. Indeed, we can go to the Process tab click on the notepad process, look at the "Cmdline" subtab and extract the answer which is <code>C:\Users\JOHNDO~1\AppData\Local\Temp\7zO4FB31F24\accountNum</code>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="https://www.forensicxlab.com/assets/images/9-27ff8b18ba082b6a8c1016cb3ad01f33.png" title="PSTree" width="294" height="261" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The last question is a little bit more tricky. Windows systems maintain a set of keys in the registry database (UserAssist keys) to keep track of programs that executed. We can use the UserAssist plugin and look for the execution of brave and how long it was used (Time Focused). The answer is <strong>04:01:54</strong></p>

<p>To conclude this writeup, we were able to use the VolWeb platform to easly get answers and make our investigation more efficient. VolWeb is based on volatility3 and therefore doesn't fully cover all the cyberdefenders.org memory analysis challenges questions at the moment. Happy hunting !</p>]]></content:encoded>
